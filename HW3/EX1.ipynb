Therefore, proper clearance and regulation are essential to maintain various physiological processes carried out by the cellular mechanism, including mitophagy and autophagy, by breaking down the damaged intracellular connections under the influence of various genes and proteins and protecting against various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Huntington disease (HD). In this review, we will discuss the role of autophagy, selective macroautophagy, or mitophagy, and its role in neurodegenerative diseases along with normal physiology. In addition, this review will provide a better understanding of the pathways involved in neuron autophagy and mitophagy and how mutations affect these pathways in the various genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Various new findings indicate that the pathways that remove dysfunctional mitochondria are impaired in these diseases, leading to the deposition of damaged mitochondria. Apart from that, we have also discussed the therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy and mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. The mitophagy cycle results in the degradation of damaged mitochondria and the biogenesis of new healthy mitochondria, also highlighting different stages at which a particular neurodegenerative disease could occur.', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36326588': {'ArticleTitle': 'Pathway-based integration of multi-omics data reveals lipidomics alterations validated in an Alzheimer&#180;s Disease mouse model and risk loci carriers.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Alzheimer&#180;s Disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Despite increasing evidence of the importance of metabolic dysregulation in AD, the underlying metabolic changes that may impact amyloid plaque formation are not understood, particularly for late onset AD. This study analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics and proteomics data obtained from several data repositories to obtain differentially expressed (DE) multi-omics elements in mouse models of AD. We characterized the metabolic modulation in these datasets using gene ontology, transcription factor, pathway, and cell-type enrichment analyses. A predicted lipid signature was extracted from genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN) and subsequently validated in a lipidomic dataset derived from cortical tissue of ABCA-7 null mice, a mouse model of one of the genes associated with late onset AD. Moreover, a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed to further characterize the association between dysregulated lipid metabolism in human blood serum and genes associated with AD risk. We found 203 DE transcripts, 164 DE proteins and 58 DE GWAS-derived mouse orthologs associated with significantly enriched metabolic biological processes. Lipid and bioenergetics metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented across the AD multi-omics datasets. Microglia and astrocytes were significantly enriched in the lipid-predominant AD-metabolic transcriptome. We also extracted a predicted lipid signature that was validated and robustly modelled class separation in the ABCA7 mice cortical lipidome, with 11 of these lipid species exhibiting statistically significant modulations. MWAS revealed 298 AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-metabolite associations, of which 70% corresponded to lipid classes. These results support the importance of lipid metabolism dysregulation in AD and highlight the suitability of mapping AD multi-omics data into GSMNs to identify metabolic alterations.', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36326095': {'ArticleTitle': 'Risk factors for dementia in Brazil: Differences by region and race.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Twelve risk factors (RFs) account for 40% of dementia cases worldwide.

In this study, we further investigated the beneficial effects on cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice and a mouse model of diabetic AD (APP/PS1xdb/db mice). Interestingly, intragastric administration of GP-75 (40&#8201;mg/kg/day) for 3&#160;months significantly attenuated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice. GP-75 treatment markedly reduced the levels of glucose, HbA1c and insulin in serum and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in APP/PS1xdb/db mice. Notably, GP-75 treatment decreased the &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) burden, as measured by 11 C-PIB PET imaging. Importantly, GP-75 treatment increased brain glucose uptake as measured by 18 F-FDG PET imaging.

Visual system might be precociously altered, especially for its cholinergic connections. We thus studied patients with aMCI compared to AD with paired-pulse flash-visual evoked potentials (paired-F-VEPs), a putative marker of cholinergic function. Methods. We enrolled 12 adult patients with aMCI and 12 with AD. 14 normal age- and sex-matched subjects acted as controls (HS). Stimuli were single flashes, with interspersed random flash pairs at critical interstimulus intervals (ISIs, 16.5 to 125&#8197;ms) with closed eyes. The \"single\" (unconditioned) F-VEP was split into a \"main complex\" (50 to 200&#8197;ms after the flash) and a \"late response\" (200 to 400&#8197;ms). As for paired stimulation, the \"test\" F-VEP emerged from electronic subtraction of the \"single\" F-VEP from the \"paired\"-F-VEP. Results. In the single F-VEP, P2 latency was prolonged in patients (aMCI and AD) compared to HS (p&#8201;<&#8201;.05). As to the paired F-VEPs, in aMCI the \"late response\" normal inhibition was abolished at ISIs 50-62.5&#8197;ms (p&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;.016), compared to AD and controls. No changes were detected for the \"main complex\". Conclusions. Paired-F-VEPs demonstrate a defective neural inhibition in the visual system of patients with aMCI at critical intervals. It may represent a compensatory mechanism against neuronal loss, the failure of which may be involved in AD development. Paired-F-VEPs may warrant inclusion in future preclinical/clinical studies, to evaluate its potential role in the pathophysiology and management of aMCI.', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36325483': {'ArticleTitle': 'Corrigendum: Amyloid pathology induces dysfunction of systemic neurotransmission in aged APPswe/PS2 mice.', 'ArticleAbstract': '[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fnins.2022.930613.].', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36324417': {'ArticleTitle': 'Decreased integrity of the monoaminergic tract is associated with a positive response to MPH in patients with vascular cognitive impairment - proof of principle study STREAM-VCI.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) are very heterogeneous in both symptoms and type of cerebrovascular pathology.

This has a clear impact on the health and quality of life of the patient. Hospitalization increases the risk of sleep disturbances due to inactivity, some sensory deprivation and daytime hypovigilance. The therapeutic gardens offer in an attractive, sensorially stimulating setting and exposed to natural light, the possibility of an adapted physical exercise. Their impact on the quality and quantity of sleep in cognitive-behavioral units has been evaluated in an exploratory manner. The hypnogram of two groups of 30 patients was compared depending on whether they used the garden (weather permitting, in summer) or not (in winter).

AD worsens over time and greatly impacts patients' life and affects their important mental functions, including thinking, the ability to carry on a conversation, and judgment and response to environment. Clinically, there is no single test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer disease. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to help in AD diagnosis by observing critical changes in the size of different brain areas, typically parietal and temporal lobes areas. In this work, an integrative mulitresolutional ensemble deep learning-based framework is proposed to achieve better predictive performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Unlike ResNet, DenseNet and their variants proposed pipeline utilizes PartialNet in a hierarchical design tailored to AD detection using brain MRIs. The advantage of the proposed analysis system is that PartialNet diversified the depth and deep supervision. Additionally, it also incorporates the properties of identity mappings which makes it powerful in better learning due to feature reuse. Besides, the proposed ensemble PartialNet is better in vanishing gradient, diminishing forward-flow with low number of parameters and better training time in comparison to its counter network. The proposed analysis pipeline has been tested and evaluated on benchmark ADNI dataset collected from 379 subjects patients. Quantitative validation of the obtained results documented our framework's capability, outperforming state-of-the-art learning approaches for both multi-and binary-class AD detection.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36322470': {'ArticleTitle': \"Estimating prevalence of early Alzheimer's disease in the United States, accounting for racial and ethnic diversity.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Updated estimates of the US Alzheimer's disease (AD) population, including under-represented populations, are needed to improve clinical trial diversity.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36321981': {'ArticleTitle': 'Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities: An Update.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) is a term introduced in 2010 to encompass a spectrum of MRI findings observed in patients receiving investigational anti-amyloid beta (A&#946;) immunotherapies for Alzheimer disease (AD).

To gain a detail of calcium ions' role in the full-length A&#946;1-42 and A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ monomers contact, the cellular membrane before their aggregation to elucidate the neurotoxicity mechanism, we carried out 2.5&#160;&#956;s extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MD) to rigorous explorations of the intriguing feature of the A&#946;1-42 and A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ interaction with the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer in the presence of calcium ions. The outcome of the results compared to the same simulations without calcium ions. We surprisingly noted robust binding energies between the A&#946;1-42 and membrane observed in simulations containing without calcium ions and is two and a half fold lesser in the simulation with calcium ions. Therefore, in the case of the absence of calcium ions, N-terminal residues of A&#946;1-42 deeply penetrate from the surface to the center of the bilayer; in contrast to calcium ions presence, the N- and C-terminal residues are involved only in surface contacts through binding phosphate moieties. On the other hand, A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ actively participated in surface bilayer contacts in the absence of calcium ions. These contacts are prevented by forming a calcium bridge between A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ and the DMPC bilayer in the case of calcium ions presence. In a nutshell, Calcium ions do not allow A&#946;1-42 penetration into the membranes nor contact of A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ with the membranes.

Abnormal MCU expression results in imbalance of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of MCU knockdown on AD hippocampal neurons and learning and memory function of AD model mice. Lentivirus and adeno-associated virus were used as vectors to transfect shRNA into hippocampal neurons (HT22 cells) and hippocampi of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1)/tau AD transgenic mice, respectively, in order to interfere with MCU expression. The cellular activity of HT22 cells was detected by MTS method, and the changes of learning and memory dysfunction in APP/PS1/tau AD transgenic mice were tested by Y maze and Morris water maze. The results showed that MCU knockdown reversed the cellular activity of HT22 cells decreased by amyloid beta protein 1-42 (A&#946;1-42) or okadaic acid (OA).

Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPRi screen in tau biosensor cells and identified cellular regulators shared by both mechanisms of tau seeding. We identified ANKLE2, BANF1, NUSAP1, EIF1AD, and VPS18 as the top validated regulators that restrict tau aggregation initiated by both exosomal and vesicle-free tau seeds. None of our validated hits affected the uptake of either form of tau seeds, supporting the notion that they operate through a cell-autonomous mechanism downstream of the seed uptake. Lastly, validation studies with human brain tissue also revealed that several of the identified protein hits are down-regulated in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, suggesting that their decreased activity may be required for the emergence or progression of tau pathology in the human brain.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36315527': {'ArticleTitle': \"Patients with Alzheimer's disease have an increased removal rate of soluble beta-amyloid-42.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Senile plaques, which are mostly composed of beta-amyloid peptide, are the main signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two main forms of beta-amyloid in humans are 40 and 42-amino acid, long; the latter is considered more relevant to AD etiology. The concentration of soluble beta-amyloid-42 (A&#946;42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-A&#946;42) and the density of amyloid depositions have a strong negative correlation. However, AD patients have lower CSF-A&#946;42 levels compared to individuals with normal cognition (NC), even after accounting for this correlation. The goal of this study was to infer deviations of A&#946;42 metabolism parameters that underlie this difference using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. A&#946;42 is released to the interstitial fluid (ISF) by cells and is removed by several processes. First, growth of insoluble fibrils by aggregation decreases the concentration of soluble beta-amyloid in the ISF. Second, A&#946;42 is physically transferred from the brain to the CSF and removed with the CSF flow. Finally, there is an intratissue removal of A&#946;42 ending in proteolysis, which can occur either in the ISF or inside the cells after the peptide is endocytosed. Unlike aggregation, which preserves the peptide in the brain, transfer to the CSF and intratissue proteolysis together represent amyloid removal. Using a kinetic model of A&#946;42 turnover, we found that compared to NC subjects, AD patients had dramatically increased rates of amyloid removal. A group with late-onset mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) also exhibited a higher rate of amyloid removal; however, this was less pronounced than in the AD group. Estimated parameters in the early-onset MCI group did not differ significantly from those in the NC group. We hypothesize that increased amyloid removal is mediated by A&#946;42 cellular uptake; this is because CSF flow is not increased in AD patients, while most proteases are intracellular. A&#946; cytotoxicity depends on both the amount of beta-amyloid internalized by cells and its intracellular conversion into toxic products. We speculate that AD and LMCI are associated with increased cellular amyloid uptake, which leads to faster disease progression. The early-onset MCI (EMCI) patients do not differ from the NC participants in terms of cellular amyloid uptake. Therefore, EMCI may be mediated by the increased production of toxic amyloid metabolites.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36315115': {'ArticleTitle': 'Association of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Pathologies With Scam Susceptibility in Older Adults.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Scam susceptibility is associated with adverse financial and health outcomes, including an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

Results EA reduced the escape latencies and distances during learning phase of MWM. The results of probe trials also indicated that EA improved memory retrieval and helped the animals recall the platform.

The DL models lose their accuracy when the dataset has an imbalanced class problem. This study aims to use the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop a reliable and efficient method for identifying Alzheimer's disease using MRI. In this study, we offer a new CNN architecture for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease with a modest number of parameters, making it perfect for training a smaller dataset. This proposed model correctly separates the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and displays class activation patterns on the brain as a heat map. The proposed Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Network (DAD-Net) is developed from scratch to correctly classify the phases of Alzheimer's disease while reducing parameters and computation costs. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a severe problem with class imbalance. Therefore, we used a synthetic oversampling technique to distribute the image throughout the classes and avoid the problem. Precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and loss are all used to compare the proposed DAD-Net against DEMENET and CNN Model.

On the basis of the aglycone part, saponins are classified into triterpenoid glycosides, steroid glycosides and alkaloid glycosides. Saponins exhibit neuroprotective activities against various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine emotion recognition ability in the health continuum \"healthy advancing age-advancing age with VRF-MCI\". The sample consisted of 106 adults divided in three diagnostic groups; 43 adults with MCI, 41 adults bearing one or more VRF, and 22 healthy controls of advancing age (HC).

LPSs have been abundantly detected in aged human brain by multiple independent research investigators, and an increased abundance of LPSs around and within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons has been found. Microbiome-generated LPSs and other endotoxins cross GI-tract biophysiological barriers into the systemic circulation and across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, a pathological process that increases during aging and in vascular disorders, including 'leaky gut syndrome'. Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity.

Additionally, clinical metadata and cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers were collected and used for analysis. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) HDL-4 subfraction levels were mostly high in female individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by AD. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) LDL-2 cholesterol was slightly elevated in male AD patients. HDL-2 apolipoprotein Apo-A1, HDL-2 phospholipids, and HDL-3 triglycerides were highly abundant in AD and MCI women compared to men. When considering clinical biomarkers (A&#946;, tau), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) VLDL-1 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) triglycerides were substantially higher in AD compared to MCI.

We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity.

We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the Xenopus secondary axis phenotype mediated by Xwnt8 injection.

A further feature selection based on the combination of serum and plasma biomarkers solved the problem and produced an even higher prediction performance than either serum or plasma biomarkers on their own.

We included 405 participants (53 AD, 66 MCI, 174 SCD, and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum f&#252;r Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia.

The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD.

An analysis of senescence markers in the aged human brain.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Aging can cause morphological transformation in human microglia indicative of cell senescence, termed microglial dystrophy. However, cellular senescence is characterized by additional changes, such as an irregular cell cycle arrest, and a variety of metabolic and molecular changes including a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, dysfunction of degradation mechanisms, and altered DNA damage response. Here, we tested whether dystrophic microglia display customary markers of cell senescence by performing double and triple staining in sections of the temporal lobe and brain stem from 14 humans. We found that markers related to oxidative damage, such as upregulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and y-H2AX, as well as inclusion of lipofuscin, do not or only exceptionally colocalize with dystrophic microglia. Further, we did not observe a decline in lamin B1 around nuclear laminae in either dystrophic or ramified microglia within the same microscopic field. Only ferritin expression, which is known to increase with aging in CNS microglia, was frequently observed in dystrophic, but rarely in ramified microglial cells. We conclude that neither dystrophic nor ramified microglia in human brain exhibit significant expression of conventional senescence markers associated with oxidative stress, and that ferritin is the dominant immunophenotypic change related to microglial aging. We suggest that multiple pathogenic mechanisms other than those driving cellular senescence contribute to dystrophic transformation of microglia.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36285785': {'ArticleTitle': 'Comparing the Relationships of Genetically Proxied PCSK9 Inhibition With Mood Disorders, Cognition, and Dementia Between Men and Women: A Drug-Target Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Background PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors are important therapeutic options for reducing cardiovascular disease risk; however, questions remain regarding potential differences in the neuropsychiatric impact of long-term PCSK9 inhibition between men and women. Methods and Results Using PCSK9 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms from European ancestry-based genome-wide association studies of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (N=1&#8201;320&#8201;016), circulating PCSK9 protein levels (N=10&#8201;186), tissue-specific PCSK9 gene expression, sex-specific genome-wide association studies of anxiety, depression, cognition, insomnia, and dementia (ranging from 54&#8201;321 to 194&#8201;174), we used drug-target inverse variance-weighted Mendelian randomization (MR) and complementary MR methods (MR Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode) to investigate potential neuropsychiatric consequences of genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition in men and women. We failed to find evidence surpassing correction for multiple comparisons of relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and the risk for the 12 neuropsychiatric end points in either men or women. Drug-target analyses were generally well-powered to detect effect estimates at several hypothesized thresholds for both combined-sex and sex-specific end points, especially analyses using PCSK9 instruments derived from protein and expression quantitative trait loci. Further, MR estimates across complementary MR methods and additional models using genetic instruments derived from circulating PCSK9 protein levels and tissue-specific PCSK9 expression were in alignment, strengthening causal inference. Conclusions Genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition showed a neutral neuropsychiatric side effect profile with no major sex-specific differences.

Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is necessary for the development of strategies for AD prevention and/or treatment, and modeling of this pathology is an important step in achieving this goal. &#946;-amyloid peptide (A&#946;) injection is a widely used approach for modeling AD. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the model constructed by injection of A&#946; in combination with a prooxidant cocktail (ferrous sulfate, A&#946;, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (FAB)) best reflects the natural development of this disease. The relationship between oxidative stress and A&#946; deposition and their respective roles in A&#946;-induced pathology in different animal models of AD have been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we compared the effects of A&#946; 1-42 alone with that of A&#946;-associated oxidative stress induced by the FAB cocktail on the neurodegeneration of hippocampal cells in vitro. We constructed a FAB-induced AD model using rat primary hippocampal cells and analyzed the contribution of each compound. The study mainly focused on the prooxidant aspects of AD pathogenesis. Moreover, cellular bioenergetics was assessed and routine metabolic tests were performed to determine the usefulness of this model. The data clearly show that aggregated A&#946;1-42 alone is significantly less toxic to hippocampal cells. Aggregated A&#946; damages neurons, and glial cells proliferate to remove A&#946; from the hippocampus. External prooxidant agents (Fe2+) or inhibition of internal antioxidant defense by BSO has more toxic effects on hippocampal cells than aggregated A&#946; alone. Moreover, hippocampal cells fight against A&#946;-induced damage more effectively than against oxidative damage. However, the combination of A&#946; with external oxidative damage and inhibition of internal antioxidant defense is even more toxic, impairs cellular defense systems, and may mimic the late phase of AD-associated cell damage.

Therefore, in this study, we designed three stable ternary co-amorphous systems to improve the physicochemical properties of the binary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT. The ternary co-amorphous systems were prepared with AP, OMT, and trans-cinnamic acid (CA), p-hydroxycinnamic acid (pHCA), or ferulic acid (FA). Intermolecular hydrogen bonds were confirmed by spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Solubility studies showed that the solubility of the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA was significantly increased compared with that of crystalline AP. Dissolution experiments suggested that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA exhibited better dissolution behavior without significant recrystallization compared to the binary co-amorphous AP-OMT. The stability study confirmed that the ternary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA maintained good physical stability in the long term for 18 months. In addition, pharmacological experiments revealed that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA have an excellent safety profile and its anti-Alzheimer's disease effects are significantly improved compared to that of the binary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT.

Title/abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction were performed by 2-7 independent reviewers. The prevalence of cSVD and study sample size were extracted by pre-defined world regions and health status. The Risk of Bias for Non-randomized Studies tool was used. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022311133). A meta-analysis of proportion was performed to assess the prevalence of different MRI markers of cSVD and a meta-regression was performed to investigate associations between cSVD prevalence and type of study, age, and male: female ratio.Of 2,743 studies identified, 42 spanning 12 global regions were included in the systematic review. Most of the identified studies were from China (n=23). The median prevalence of moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) was 20.5%, 40.5%, and 58.4% in the community, stroke, and dementia groups, respectively. The median prevalence of lacunes was 0.8% and 33.52% in the community and stroke groups. The mean prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) was 10.7% and 22.4% in the community and stroke groups. The mean prevalence of moderate-to-severe perivascular spaces was 25.0% in the community. Meta-regression analyses showed that the weighted median age (51.4 &#177; 0.0 years old; range: 36.3-80.2) was a significant predictor of the prevalence of moderate-to-severe WMH and lacunes, while the type of study was a significant predictor of the prevalence of CMB.

Many factors affect the onset and development of AD, but specific mechanisms underlying the disease are unclear. Most studies investigating AD have focused on neurons and the gray matter in the central nervous system (CNS) but have not led to effective treatments. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the white matter (WM). Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD. Myelin sheaths, the main component of WM in the CNS, wrap and insulate axons to ensure conduction of the rapid action potential and axonal integrity. WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear. Given the heavy burden of medical treatment, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is vital.

When monitored using the fluorescence of either non-covalent thioflavin T or HiLyte Fluor 647 dye covalently attached to the Ab1-42 peptide, the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42 were markedly more rapid in the presence of NQO1*2 than the wild-type NQO1. Experiments using apo-NQO1 indicate that this increase is linked to the inability of NQO1*2 to bind to FAD.

Attendees (32%) also perceived an increase in ADRD knowledge from attending AWG and 89.1% believed more African Americans should participate in research. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of a culturally tailored community education program to enhance knowledge, clinical trial interest, and recruitment into observational studies and lifestyle ADRD clinical trials among older African Americans. Education programs developed in partnership with the community can serve as bridge to research participation for underrepresented minorities in clinical research.

It remains frustratingly unclear why this protein accumulates and how it contributes to Alzheimer's Disease pathology. In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid &#946; is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid &#946; gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid &#946; expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid &#946; confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid &#946; expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid &#946; at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid &#946; is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid &#946; in the brain. The model recommends attention to innate immune negative regulation in the brain to discover ways to restore these functions toward a youthful state in the elderly.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36281661': {'ArticleTitle': 'Blood Biomarkers from Research Use to Clinical Practice: What Must Be Done?

NPS were recorded through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) while cognitive and functional impairment was assessed using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SoB) score at baseline and follow-up visits.

As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSR&#945;-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSR&#945;-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR&#945;-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSR&#945; was inversely correlated with amyloid-&#946; plaques and &#946;-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (<0.03&#8197;&#181;l/g&#183;s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSR&#946; that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the present data in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brains and an animal model of Alzheimer's disease indicate that defects in the insulin receptor localized at the blood-brain barrier strongly contribute to brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease, in association with &#946;-amyloid pathology.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36280008': {'ArticleTitle': 'Selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 aggravated cognitive dysfunction in 3xTg-AD mice.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Cognitive dysfunction is the main clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Furthermore, recent research found that dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonist might affect A&#946; level and cognitive dysfunction in AD, but the effects of OX1R or OX2R alone is unreported until now. Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated. In the present study, selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 was used to block OX1R. Then, different behavioral tests were performed to observe the effects of OX1R blockade on cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited both A&#946; and tau pathology, in vivo electrophysiological recording and western blot were used to investigate the potential mechanism. The results showed that chronic OX1R blockade aggravated the impairments of short-term working memory, long-term spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice, increased levels of soluble A&#946; oligomers and p-tau, and decreased PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice.

Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment.

Our paper evaluates the recent scientific literature on AD from a historical and philosophical perspective. We show that AD research is a classic example of the boundary work at play in a field in crisis: both parties deploy historical and philosophical references to illustrate what counts as good and bad science, as proper scientific method and appropriate scientific conduct. We also show that boundary work has proved unable to point a way out of the deadlock and argue that the science system's tools for establishing scientific quality, such as peer review and the grant system, are unlikely to resolve the crisis. Rather, they consolidate the dominant model's position even more. In conclusion, we suggest that some kind of reverse boundary-work is needed that reopens the discussion on the nature of AD, an issue that has never been settled scientifically.

In this paper, an AD prediction algorithm based on group convolution and a joint loss function is proposed. First, a group convolutional backbone network based on ResNet18 is designed to extract lesion features from multiple channels, which makes the expression ability of the network improved to a great extent. Then, a hybrid attention mechanism is presented, which enables the network to focus on target regions and learn feature weights, so as to enhance the network's learning ability of the lesion regions that are relevant to disease diagnosis. Finally, a joint loss function, that avoids the overfitting phenomenon, increases the generalization of the model, and improves prediction accuracy by adding a regularization loss function to the conventional cross-entropy function, is proposed. Experiments conducted on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that the algorithm we proposed gives a prediction accuracy improvement of 2.4% over that of the current AD prediction algorithm, thus proving the effectiveness and availability of the new algorithm.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36276653': {'ArticleTitle': 'Advancing 89Zr-immuno-PET in neuroscience with a bispecific anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody - The choice of chelator is essential.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"The accelerated approval of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) aducanumab as a treatment option for Alzheimer's Disease and the continued discussions about its efficacy have shown that a better understanding of immunotherapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is needed. 89Zr-immuno-PET could be a suitable tool to open new avenues for the diagnosis of CNS disorders, monitoring disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutics. Herein, three different 89Zr-labeling strategies and direct radioiodination with 125I of a bispecific anti-amyloid-beta aducanumab derivate, consisting of aducanumab with a C-terminal fused anti-transferrin receptor binding single chain Fab fragment derived from 8D3 (Adu-8D3), were compared ex vivo and in vivo with regard to brain uptake and target engagement in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model and wild type animals. Methods: Adu-8D3 and a negative control antibody, based on the HIV specific B12 antibody also carrying C-terminal fused 8D3 scFab (B12-8D3), were each conjugated with NCS-DFO, NCS-DFO*, or TFP-N-suc-DFO-Fe-ester, followed by radiolabeling with 89Zr. 125I was used as a substitute for 124I for labeling of both antibodies. 30 &#181;g of radiolabeled mAb, corresponding to approximately 6 MBq 89Zr or 2.5 MBq 125I, were injected per mouse. PET imaging was performed 1, 3 and 7 days post injection (p.i.). All mice were sacrificed on day 7 p.i. and subjected to ex vivo biodistribution and brain autoradiography. Immunostaining on brain tissue was performed after autoradiography for further validation. Results: Ex vivo biodistribution revealed that the brain uptake of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 (2.19 &#177;0.12 %ID/g) was as high as for its 125I-analog (2.21 &#177;0.15 %ID/g). [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-N-suc-Adu-8D3 showed significantly lower uptake (< 0.65 %ID/g), being in the same range as for the 89Zr-labeled controls (B12-8D3). Autoradiography of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [125I]I-Adu-8D3 showed an amyloid-beta related granular uptake pattern of radioactivity. In contrast, the [89Zr]Zr-DFO-conjugates and the control antibody groups did not show any amyloid-beta related uptake pattern, indicating that DFO is inferior for 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging of the brain in comparison to DFO* for Adu-8D3. This was confirmed by day 7 PET images showing only amyloid-beta related brain uptake for [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3. In wild type animals, such an uptake was not observed. Immunostaining showed a co-localization of all administered Adu-8D3 conjugates with amyloid-beta plaques. Conclusion: We successfully demonstrated that 89Zr-immuno-PET is suitable for imaging and quantifying amyloid-beta specific brain uptake using a bispecific aducanumab brain shuttling antibody, Adu-8D3, but only when using the novel chelator DFO*, and not DFO, for labeling with 89Zr.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36276649': {'ArticleTitle': \"A sporadic Alzheimer's blood-brain barrier model for developing ultrasound-mediated delivery of Aducanumab and anti-Tau antibodies.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Rationale: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major impediment to therapeutic intracranial drug delivery for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Focused ultrasound applied together with microbubbles (FUS+MB) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS+MB is safe, however, the effects of FUS+MB on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated. In addition, there currently are no cell platforms to test for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells (induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We established mono- and co-culture models of human sporadic AD and control BBB cells to investigate the effects of FUS+MB on BBB cell phenotype and to screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies, an Aducanumab-analogue (AduhelmTM; anti-amyloid-&#946;) and a novel anti-Tau antibody, RNF5. We then developed a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a step towards a more physiologically relevant FUS+MB drug delivery platform. Results: When compared to untreated cells, the delivery of Aducanumab-analogue and RNF5 was significantly increased (up to 1.73 fold), across the Transwell-based BBB models following FUS+MB treatment. Our results also demonstrated the safety of FUS+MB indicated by minimal changes in iBEC transcriptome as well as little or no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the first 24 h post FUS+MB. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful iBEC barrier formation in our novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model with significantly increased delivery (1.4 fold) of Aducanumab-analogue following FUS+MB. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a robust and reproducible approach to utilize patient cells for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery screening in vitro. With such a cell platform for FUS+MB research previously not reported, it has the potential to identify novel FUS+MB-deliverable drugs as well as screen for cell- and patient-specific effects of FUS+MB, accelerating the use of FUS+MB as a therapeutic modality in AD.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36276340': {'ArticleTitle': 'Association between community-level social trust and the risk of dementia: A retrospective cohort study in the Republic of Korea.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'It is known that biological risk factors and lifestyle behaviors are important determinants of dementia.

Rafts are believed to impact the development of different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's ones, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, some types of cancer, etc. These diseases correlate with the change in the membrane lipid composition resulting from an oxidative stress, age-related processes, dysfunction of proteins, and many others. In particular, a lot of studies report a significant rise in the level of lysolipids. Physicochemical properties of rafts are determined by membrane composition, in particular, by the content of lysolipids. Lysolipids may thus regulate raft-involving processes. However, the exact mechanism of such regulation is unknown. Although studying rafts in vivo still seems to be rather complicated, liquid-ordered domains are well observed in model systems. In the present study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine how lysophospholipids influence the liquid-ordered domains in model ternary membranes. We demonstrated that even a small amount of lysolipids in a membrane significantly impacts domain size depending on the saturation of the lysolipid hydrocarbon tails and the amount of cholesterol. The mixture with the bigger relative fraction of cholesterol was more susceptible to the action of lysolipids.

Hearing loss is one of the modifiable risk factors for dementia, with approximately 4 million of the 50 million cases of dementia worldwide possibly attributed to untreated HL. This paper describes four possible mechanisms that have been suggested for the relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia. The first mechanism suggests mitochondrial dysfunction and altered signal pathways due to aging as a possible link between ARHL and AD. The second mechanism proposes that sensory degradation in hearing impaired people could explain the relationship between ARHL and AD. The occupation of cognitive resource (third) mechanism indicates that the association between ARHL and AD is a result of increased cognitive processing that is required to compensate for the degraded sensory input. The fourth mechanism is an expansion of the third mechanism, i.e., the function and structure interaction involves both cognitive resource occupation (neural activity) and AD pathology as the link between ARHL and AD. Exploring the specific mechanisms that provide the link between ARHL and AD has the potential to lead to innovative ideas for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of AD. This paper also provides insight into the current evidence for the use of hearing treatments as a possible treatment/prevention for AD, and if auditory assessments could provide an avenue for early detection of cognitive impairment associated with AD.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36275416': {'ArticleTitle': 'Prevalence of Comorbid Dementia in Late-life Depression and Bipolar Disorder: A Retrospective Inpatient Study.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Dementia in patients with late-life mood disorders is clinically important.', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36275415': {'ArticleTitle': 'Porphyromonas gingivalis Conditioned Medium Induces Amyloidogenic Processing of the Amyloid-&#946; Protein Precursor upon in vitro Infection of SH-SY5Y Cells.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Cleavage of the amyloid-&#946; protein precursor (A&#946;PP) mediated by host secretase enzymes, releases several fragments including amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;40 and A&#946;42).', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36275414': {'ArticleTitle': 'Interaction Mechanism Between the HSV-1 Glycoprotein B and the Antimicrobial Peptide Amyloid-&#946;.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Unravelling the mystery of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires urgent resolution given the worldwide increase of the aging population.

Increasing evidence suggests that aggregating A&#946; drives tau accumulation, a process that involves synaptic degeneration leading to cognitive impairment. Conversely, there is a realization that non-fibrillar (oligomeric) forms of A&#946; mediate toxicity in AD. Fibrillar (filamentous) aggregates of proteins across the spectrum of the primary and secondary tauopathies were the focus of recent structural studies with a filament structure based nosologic classification, but less emphasis was given to non-filamentous co-aggregates of insoluble proteins in the fractions derived from post-mortem human brains. Here, we revisited sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble extracts to characterize tau and A&#946; species by quantitative targeted mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy. AD brain sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were greatly enriched with A&#946;42 at almost equimolar levels to N-terminal truncated microtubule binding region (MTBR) isoforms of tau with multiple site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides. This indicates that the major proportion of the enriched tau was the aggregation prone N-terminal and proline rich region (PRR) of truncated mixed 4R and 3R tau with more 4R than 3R isoforms. High concentration and occupancies of site-specific phosphorylation pT181 (~&#8201;22 %) and pT217 (~&#8201;16 %) (key biomarkers of AD) along with other PTMs in the PRR and MTBR indicated a regional susceptibility of PTMs in aggregated tau. Immunogold labelling revealed that tau may exist in globular non-filamentous form (N-terminal intact tau) co-localized with A&#946; in the sarkosyl-insoluble pellets along with tau filaments (N-truncated MTBR tau). Our results suggest a model that A&#946; and tau interact forming globular aggregates, from which filamentous tau and A&#946; emerge.

Dynamic [15O]H2O, [18F]florbetapir and [18F]flortaucipir PET test-retest (TrT) datasets with eleven, nine and fourteen subjects, respectively, were included. Analyses were performed using an arterial input model and/or a simplified reference tissue model, depending on the data available. Relative CBF values (i.e. K1/K1' and/or R1) were obtained using cerebellar cortex as reference tissue and TrT repeatability (i.e. precision) was calculated and compared between tracers, parameters and clinical groups. Relative CBF had significantly better TrT repeatability than absolute CBF derived from [15O]H2O (r&#8201;=&#8201;-0.53), while best TrT repeatability was observed for [18F]florbetapir and [18F]flortaucipir R1 (r&#8201;=&#8201;-0.23, r&#8201;=&#8201;-0.33). Furthermore, only R1 showed, better TrT repeatability for cognitively normal individuals.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit various health effects on the host and are expected to have protective effects on neurological functions via brain-gut correlation. However, the protective effects of LAB against A&#946; are not well understood. We investigated whether LAB feeding could ameliorate the toxicity of A&#946; peptide accumulation in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing the human A&#946; peptide in neurons or muscle as an AD model. A&#946; expressed in muscle caused myopathy and worm paralysis, while A&#946; in neurons disturbed chemotactic activity. Among 14 screened strains, Lactococcus laudensis (LL) and Pediococcus parvulus (PP) prevented the AD worms from losing their chemotaxis behavior and becoming paralyzed by the A&#946; peptide.

To mitigate this, we first extracted AD subnetworks from several protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases and labeled these with genotype information (number of missense variants) to make them patient-specific.

We tested different PPI databases and compared the performance of the GNN models to baseline models using classical machine learning techniques, as well as randomized networks and input datasets. The overall results showed that GNNs could not outperform a baseline predictor only using the APOE gene, suggesting that missense variants are not sufficient to explain disease risk beyond the APOE status. Nevertheless, our results show that GNNs outperformed other machine learning techniques and that protein-protein interactions lead to superior results compared to randomized networks.

The best cellular correlates of the early cognitive deficits in AD patients are synapse loss and gliosis. In particular, it is unclear whether the activation of microglia (microgliosis) has a neuroprotective or pathological role early in AD. Here we report that microgliosis is an early mediator of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of increased amyloidosis. We found that the appearance of microgliosis, synaptic dysfunction and behavioral impairment coincided with increased soluble A&#946;42 levels, and occurred well before the presence of A&#946; plaques. Inhibition of microglial activity by treatment with minocycline (MC) reduced gliosis, synaptic deficits and cognitive impairments at early pathological stages and was most effective when provided preventive, i.e., before the onset of microgliosis.

Despite extensive study, however, the exact mechanism underlying aggregate formation in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, as does the contribution of these aggregates to disease progression. Importantly, a recent evaluation of current Alzheimer's disease animal models suggested that rodent models are not able to fully recapitulate the pathological intricacies of the disease as it occurs in humans. Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to species that might make good alternatives to rodents for studying the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The sheep (Ovis aries) is one such species, although to date, there have been few molecular studies relating to Alzheimer's disease in sheep. Here, we investigated the Alzheimer's disease relevant histopathological characteristics of 22 sheep, using anti-&#946;-amyloid (Abcam 12267 and mOC64) and phosphorylation specific anti-tau (AT8 and S396) antibodies. We identified numerous intraneuronal aggregates of both &#946;-amyloid and tau that are consistent with early Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. We confirmed the expression of two 3-repeat (1N3R, 2N3R) and two 4-repeat (1N4R, 2N4R) tau isoforms in the ovine brain, which result from the alternative splicing of two tau exons. Finally, we investigated the phosphorylation status of the serine396 residue in 30 sheep, and report that the phosphorylation of this residue begins in sheep aged as young as 2&#160;years. Together, these data show that sheep exhibit naturally occurring &#946;-amyloid and tau pathologies, that reflect those that occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

However, such studies have also produced conflicting results. A new mtDNA association model, the 'variant load model' (VLM), has been applied to multiple disease phenotypes. Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations. Importantly our analysis showed this finding is not primarily being driven by many rare population variants dispersed across the mtDNA, but by a few more frequent variants with high MutPred scores. It is suggested the variants in question do not exert a mildly deleterious effect in their most frequent haplogroup context.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36264717': {'ArticleTitle': 'MicroRNA signatures in genetic frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'MicroRNAs are promising biomarkers of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but discrepant results between studies have so far hampered their use in clinical trials.

The data of MR scanning of the brain, bilateral MRS scan of the hippocampus, thyroid function and other laboratory indicators, and neuropsychological evaluation analysis were collected in 50 patients who had been diagnosed with AD. According to CDR, 50 patients were divided into the early AD group and the middle and advanced AD group, with 23 patients in the early AD group and 27 patients in the middle and advanced AD group.

Moreover, the comparative analysis was carried out. The results showed that the MTA grade of medial temporal atrophy increased with the progressive severity of the disease in both groups. A statistical test was conducted on the reduction of hippocampal volume in the two groups, and the P was less than 0.05. Therefore, the MTA scale was of great value in the diagnosis and staging of early AD. However, when the diagnosis of early AD was treated by MTA visual evaluation alone, there was 23.8% false negative diagnosis.

Whether BACE1 and neurogranin levels are persistent traits or change with disease progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF neurogranin and BACE1 concentrations differ between A/T/N stages, whether these change over time and correlate with memory decline.

We used CSF markers to determine A/T/N stage using amyloid beta42/40 ratio, p-tau181 and total-tau respectively in predementia Alzheimer's disease cases (n = 176) [including cases that progressed to dementia (n = 10)] and controls (n = 74) from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort. We selected cases at the presumed early (A+/T-/N-, n = 86) and late stages (A+/T+/N+, n = 90) of the Alzheimer's disease continuum and controlled with normal markers (A-/T-/N-, n = 74). A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed. Next, we measured changes in CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in cases that progressed from A-/T-/N- to A+/T-/N- (n = 12), from A+/T-/N- to A+/T or N+ (n = 12), remained stable A+/T-/N- (n = 26), remained stable A+/T+/N+ (n = 28) compared with controls remaining stable A-/T-/N- (n = 33). Lastly, associations between these markers and memory decline were assessed. Compared with A-/T-/N- healthy controls, neurogranin was unaltered in A+/T-/N- (n.s.) but higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001). In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (P < 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001). The neurogranin/BACE1 ratio was increased in both A+/T-/N- (P < 0.05) and A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001) groups as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls and was more strongly associated with memory decline (b = -0.29, P = 0.0006) than neurogranin (b = -0.20, P = 0.002) and BACE1 (b = -0.13, P = 0.046).

However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2&#945; and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2&#945; without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2&#945; and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent.

The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-A&#946; VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and A&#946; plaques at concentrations as low as 0.22 nM. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex, likely because the concentration required for NT-induced hypothermia was lower than the concentration required to produce in situ labeling. These findings reveal an important dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with A&#946;-plaques in cortex.

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS for relevant articles published up to November 1, 2021. Of 1215 identified records, we selected and systematically reviewed 53 articles that compared connectivity features between patients with DLB and healthy controls. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease-related decreases in local and global network efficiency.

The tau-mediated disease mechanisms that drive neurodegenerative disease are still unknown. Tau interactome studies are critically important for understanding tauopathy. They reveal the interacting partners that define disease pathways, and the tau interactions present in neuropathological aggregates provide potential insight into the cellular environment and protein interactions present during pathological tau aggregation. Here we provide a combined analysis of 12 tau interactome studies of human brain tissue, human cell culture models and rodent models of disease. Together, these studies identified 2084 proteins that interact with tau in human tissue and 1152 proteins that interact with tau in rodent models of disease. Our combined analysis of the tau interactome revealed consistent enrichment of interactions between tau and proteins involved in RNA binding, ribosome, and proteasome function. Comparison of human and rodent tau interactome studies revealed substantial differences between the two species. We also performed a second analysis to identify the tau interacting proteins that are enriched in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration or neurofibrillary tangle pathology. These results revealed a timed dysregulation of tau interactions as pathology develops.

In this study, we have developed a new approach based on 3D deep convolutional neural networks to accurately differentiate mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal individuals using structural MRIs. For comparison, we have built a reference model based on the volumes and thickness of previously reported brain regions that are known to be implicated in disease progression. We validate both models on an internal held-out cohort from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on an external independent cohort from The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). The deep-learning model is accurate, achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 85.12 when distinguishing between cognitive normal subjects and subjects with either MCI or mild Alzheimer's dementia. In the more challenging task of detecting MCI, it achieves an AUC of 62.45. It is also significantly faster than the volume/thickness model in which the volumes and thickness need to be extracted beforehand. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimer's disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface.

The interaction of iron accumulation with &#945;-syn and tau was further explored as an essential pathological mechanism of PDD. However, the links and mechanisms between these factors remain unclear. Studies have shown that the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases such as PDD are closely related to the separation of abnormal phases. Substances such as proteins can form droplets through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) under normal physiological conditions and even undergo further liquid-solid phase transitions to form solid aggregates under disease or regulatory disorders, leading to pathological phenomena. By analyzing the existing literature, we propose that LLPS is the crucial mechanism causing abnormal accumulation of &#945;-syn, tau, and other proteins in PDD, and its interaction with iron metabolism disorder is the key factor driving ferroptosis in PDD. Therefore, we believe that LLPS can serve as one of the means to explain the pathological mechanism of PDD.

In contrast to A&#946;, abnormally phosphorylated &#964; (p-&#964;) can also be found in non-AD tauopathies. In AD, p-&#964; is the main component of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which result from aggregation of abnormally phosphorylated and folded &#964;. In this review, we discuss the role of p-&#964; pathology in Alzheimer's disease considering neuropathological, biochemical, cellular, animal model, and clinical findings. We discuss the relationship between p-&#964; and other AD-related proteins such as A&#946; and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). In light of the current state of knowledge, we conclude that p-&#964; aggregation known as primary age-related tauopathy (PART) may represent a prerequisite for the development of AD rather that a downstream effect of A&#946; toxicity. However, A&#946; as well as TDP-43 pathology appear to accelerate accumulation and propagation of p-&#964; pathology once initiated, ultimately leading to the full-blown picture of AD. In this context, &#964; seeds can induce granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), AD-typical lesions in which the activated necrosome - required for the execution of necroptosis, a programmed form of cell death - can be found. Moreover, necrosome-exhibiting GVD is associated with a decreased neuronal density. Thus, we speculate that p-&#964; pathology is a major driver for neuron loss in AD via GVD-mediated necroptosis. Overall, p-&#964; seems to play a central role in AD as it appears to constitute a prerequisite for AD development which can then be accelerated by co-factors.

To comprehensively evaluate brain iron deposition along with aging, PD-related neurodegeneration, from prodromal PD (pPD) to clinical PD (cPD), and AD-related neurodegeneration, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, a total of 726 participants from July 2013 to December 2020, including 100 young adults, 189 old adults, 184 pPD, 171 cPD, 31 MCI and 51 AD patients, were included. Quantitative susceptibility mapping data were acquired and used to quantify regional magnetic susceptibility, and the resulting spatial standard deviations were recorded. A general linear model was applied to perform the inter-group comparison. As a result, relative to young adults, old adults showed significantly higher iron deposition with higher spatial variation in all of the subcortical nuclei (p&#160;<&#160;0.01). pPD showed a high spatial variation of iron distribution in the subcortical nuclei except for substantia nigra (SN); and iron deposition in SN and red nucleus (RN) were progressively increased from pPD to cPD (p&#160;<&#160;0.01).

The hypometabolic state associated with chronic thiamine insufficiency (TI) has been demonstrated to be a contributor towards the development of amyloid plaque deposition and neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TI induced AD pathology is still unresolved. Previously, we have established that TI stabilizes the metabolic stress transcriptional factor, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1&#945; (HIF1&#945;). Utilizing neuronal hippocampal cells (HT22), TI-induced HIF1&#945; activation triggered the amyloidogenic cascade through transcriptional expression and increased activity of &#946;-secretase (BACE1). Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of HIF1&#945; during TI significantly reduced BACE1 and C-terminal Fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) formation. TI also increased the expression of the HIF1&#945; regulated pro-apoptotic protein, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19&#160;kDa protein-interacting protein (BNIP3).

For decades, research has focused on neuronal degeneration and the disruption to the neural circuits that occurs during disease progression, undervaluing in some extent the alterations to glial cells even though these alterations were described in the very first studies of this disease. In recent years, it has been recognized that different families of neuroglia are not merely support cells for neurons but rather key and active elements in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system. Alterations to different types of neuroglia (especially astroglia and microglia but also mature oligodendroglia and oligodendroglial progenitors) have been identified in the initial neuropathological changes that lead to dementia, suggesting that they may represent therapeutic targets to prevent neurodegeneration.

A precise medical diagnosis that correctly classifies AD patients results in better treatment. Currently, the most commonly used classification techniques extract features from longitudinal MRI data before creating a single classifier that performs classification. However, it is difficult to train a reliable classifier to achieve acceptable classification performance due to limited sample size and noise in longitudinal MRI data. Instead of creating a single classifier, we propose an ensemble voting method that generates multiple individual classifier predictions and then combines them to develop a more accurate and reliable classifier. The ensemble voting classifier model performs better in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for older adults than existing methods in important assessment criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.

Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A&#946;) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (w/v), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 &#176;C. After filtering the extract by 0.22 um filter, some of it was used for UHPLC analysis.

This study indicated OSE's neuroprotective impacts against neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta. Our results suggest that OSE acts as a neuroprotective agent to combat AD-specific apoptotic cell death, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, as well as synaptic dysfunction in AD mice's brains.

Different antibodies target different sites on A&#946;42 and thus elicit different neuroprotective or cytoprotective effects. In the present review, we summarize significant information reflected by anti-A&#946;42 antibodies in different immunotherapies and propose an overview of the structure (conformation)-toxicity relationship of A&#946;42 aggregates.

As isoquinoline alkaloids include galanthamine, an approved drug for Alzheimer's disease, as well as some potentially useful compounds with cytostatic potential, 28 members from this category of alkaloids were selected for a complex screening of interactions with iron and copper at four pathophysiologically relevant pH and in non-buffered conditions (dimethyl sulfoxide) by spectrophotometric methods in vitro. With the exception of the salts, all the alkaloids were able to chelate ferrous and ferric ions in non-buffered conditions, but only five of them (galanthine, glaucine, corydine, corydaline and tetrahydropalmatine) evoked some significant chelation at pH 7.5 and only the first two were also active at pH 6.8. By contrast, none of the tested alkaloids chelated cuprous or cupric ions. All the alkaloids, with the exception of the protopines, significantly reduced the ferric and cupric ions, with stronger effects on the latter. These effects were mostly dependent on the number of free aromatic hydroxyls, but not other hydroxyl groups. The most potent reductant was boldine. As most of the alkaloids chelated and reduced the ferric ions, additional experimental studies are needed to elucidate the biological relevance of these results, as chelation is expected to block reactive oxygen species formation, while reduction could have the opposite effect.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36234916': {'ArticleTitle': 'Resveratrol-Maltol and Resveratrol-Thiophene Hybrids as Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Antioxidants: Synthesis, Biometal Chelating Capability and Crystal Structure.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"New resveratrol-thiophene and resveratrol-maltol hybrids were synthesized as cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants.

The molecular docking of selected active ligands gave insight into the structures of docked enzymes.

The maltols that proved to be active cholinesterase inhibitors were able to coordinate Fe3+ ion, forming complexes of 1:1 composition. Their formation constants, determined by spectrophotometry, are very similar, lgK = 11.6-12.6, suggesting that Fe3+ binds to the common hydroxy-pyranone moiety and is hardly affected by the other aromatic part of the ligand. Accordingly, the characteristic bands in their individual absorption spectra are uniformly red-shifted relative to those of the free ligands. The crystal structures of two new resveratrol-maltol hybrids were recorded, giving additional information on the molecules' intermolecular hydrogen bonds and packing.

The presence of both cis and trans isomers in lobeline is well known, and many studies on the relationship between the structure and pharmacological activity of lobeline and its analogs have been reported. However, it is a remarkable fact that no studies have reported the differences in pharmacological activities between the two isomers. In this article, we found that different degrees of isomerization of lobeline injection have significant differences in respiratory excitatory effects in pentobarbital sodium anesthetized rats. Compared with cis-lobeline injections, the respiratory excitatory effect was significantly reduced by 50.2% after administration of injections which contained 36.9% trans-lobeline. The study on the influencing factors of isomerization between two isomers shown that this isomerization was a one-way isomerism and only converted from cis to trans, where temperature was the catalytic factor and pH was the key factor.

A similar shift to the insoluble fraction was also observed in small heat shock protein (sHSP) family molecules, such as HSP27, after stress. We further demonstrate that FAIM is recruited to sHSP-containing complexes after cellular stress induction. These data suggest that FAIM might prevent protein aggregation in concert with sHSPs. In fact, we observed the additional effect of FAIM and HSP27 on the prevention of protein aggregates using an in vitro amyloid-&#946; aggregation model system.

However, the link between 27-OHC and cholesterol homeostasis, and how this relationship relates to AD pathogenesis, remain elusive. Here, 12-month-old ApoE &#949;4 transgenic mice were injected with saline, 27-OHC, 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole, ANS), and 27-OHC+ANS for 21 consecutive days.

The indicators of cholesterol metabolism, synaptic structure, amyloid &#946; 1-42 (A&#946;1-42), and learning and memory abilities were measured. Compared with the wild-type mice, ApoE &#949;4 mice had poor memory and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, damaged brain tissue and synaptic structure, cognitive decline, and higher A&#946;1-42 levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Moreover, cholesterol transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) were up-regulated in the cortex after the 27-OHC treatment.

In vivo experiments showed that NTQ significantly mitigated cognitive impairment, A&#946; burden and neuroinflammation in a transgenic AD mouse model (5&#215;FAD). Network pharmacology results revealed that the active components of NTQ could target inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In addition, hippocampal transcriptomics suggested that NTQ regulated signaling pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Consistently, serum metabolomics further indicated that NTQ could modulate glycolipid metabolism. In summary, a combination of systems pharmacology analysis and biological validation study demonstrates that NTQ could alleviate behavioral abnormality and pathological alterations of AD by targeting glycolipid metabolism and neuroinflammation, and is accordingly a potential therapeutic agent for AD.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36228382': {'ArticleTitle': \"Sex-dependent neuro-deconvolution analysis of Alzheimer's disease brain transcriptomes according to CHI3L1 expression levels.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Glial activation and related neuroinflammatory processes play a key role in the aging and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The low CHI3L1 brain expression levels in NDHC and AD patients highlighted a neuronal activation profile. Furthermore, using drugs opposing CHI3L1 transcriptomic signatures, we found a specific drug profile for AD males and females characterized by high levels of CHI3L1 composed of fostamatinib, rucaparib, cephaeline, prednisolone, and dinoprostone.

While the majority (>&#8201;90%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92-100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59-64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1-101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., A&#946; plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We and others have used transcriptome profiling in AD patient-derived neuron models of autosomal-dominant EOAD and sporadic LOAD to identify disease endotypes (Caldwell et al.

Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages-such as the primary visual cortex-exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al.

We identified 15 studies featuring participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant - Frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), acquired brain damage, and depression. We found that music evokes AMs in these disorders, and that familiar music was more likely to evoke AMs. Compared with healthy controls, AD participants had a relative advantage for MEAMs over picture-evoked AMs. People with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex showed preserved access to MEAMs in terms of frequency, but a relative disadvantage regarding the episodic richness for MEAMs, but not for memories cued by pictures, compared to controls. Participants with bv-FTD had fewer AMs evoked after both music and pictures than healthy controls. Across conditions, MEAMs were generally specific and retrieved fast, suggesting little retrieval effort. MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music.

Based on copper coordination biochemistry, we designed specific copper chelators [tetradentate monoquinolines (TDMQs)] in order to regulate copper homeostasis in the AD brain and inhibit the deleterious oxidative stress catalyzed by copper-A&#946; complexes. We previously reported that TDMQ20, a highly selective copper chelator selected as a drug candidate, was able to extract copper from the Cu-A&#946;1-16 complex and restore cognitive and behavioral deficits in AD mouse models. For a better understanding of the mechanism of action of TDMQ20, we decided to investigate the change of profile of proteins expressed in 5xFAD mice after an oral treatment of TDMQ20 (dose = 10 mg/kg, once every two days for 3 months, in total 45 times). Clioquinol (CQ), a non-specific chelator, has been used as a comparator. Here, we report the proteomic alterations in the cortex of 5xFAD mice using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) proteomics technology. The results indicated that 178 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) have been identified in the AD mouse group with respect to wild type (WT) animals (AD/WT). After treatment by TDMQ20, 35 DEPs were found common in AD/WT and TDMQ20/AD groups in an opposite change manner (up- or down-regulated, respectively). In addition, among the 35 DEPs mentioned above, 10 common target proteins have been identified in AD/WT, TDMQ20/AD, and CQ/AD groups, among which 3 target proteins were successfully validated by western blot analysis. In particular, the expression levels of ChAT and CHRM4 are significantly increased upon TDMQ20 treatment with respect to 5xFAD mice, while CQ did not significantly change the expression of these proteins. Our study suggests the involvement of the copper chelator TDMQ20 on the cholinergic system, a feature that may explain the improved cognitive and behavioral performance in AD mice upon oral treatment of TDMQ20.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36221969': {'ArticleTitle': '[Biomarkers for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment - Recommendations from the Swiss Memory Clinics].', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Biomarkers for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment - Recommendations from the Swiss Memory Clinics Abstract.

Additionally, a subset of participants also provided paired cerebrospinal fluid samples to compare neuronal SEV miRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Neuronal SEV were isolated using differential ultracentrifugation and antibody conjugated Dynabeads&#174; for the neuronal surface marker, L1CAM. RNA sequencing was performed. 12 FTD, 11 with AD, and 10 healthy aging participants were enrolled in the study. In FTD, SEV miRNA-181c was downregulated compared to healthy controls. In AD, miRNA-122 and miRNA-3591 were downregulated compared to those in healthy controls and FTD. Using an FDR <0.2, only miRNA-21-5p was found to have increased expression in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to plasma in a group of AD and FTD participants. SEV miRNA-181c is significantly downregulated in FTD compared to healthy controls and may mediate its effects through microglial-directed neuroinflammation and interaction with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) based on pathway analysis. Additionally, the FOXO and Hippo pathways may be important mediators of FTD, based on pathway analysis.

In this context, animal models that progressively display AD pathological hallmarks (e.g. TgF344-AD) become crucial. Translational technologies, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), enable the longitudinal metabolic characterization of this disease. However, an integrative approach is required to unravel the complex metabolic changes underlying AD progression, from early to advanced stages. TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) rats were studied in vivo on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, for longitudinal quantitative assessment of brain metabolic profile changes using MRS. Disease progression was investigated at 4 time points, from 9 to 18&#160;months of age, and in 4 regions: cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group. Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic coupling in each group. Thus, in cortex, strong couplings of N-acetylaspartate and creatine with myo-inositol in WT, but with taurine in TgF344-AD rats were observed; whereas in the hippocampus, myo-inositol, taurine and choline compounds levels were highly correlated in WT but not in TgF344-AD animals. Furthermore, specific cortex-hippocampus-striatum metabolic crosstalks were found for taurine levels in the WT group but for myo-inositol levels in the TgF344-AD rats. With a systems biology perspective of metabolic changes in AD pathology, our results shed light into the complex spatio-temporal metabolic rewiring in this disease, reported here for the first time. Age- and tissue-dependent imbalances between myo-inositol, taurine and other metabolites, such as creatine, unveil their role in disease progression, while pointing to the inadequacy of the latter as an internal reference for quantification.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36216800': {'ArticleTitle': 'Age-linked suppression of lipoxin A4 associates with cognitive deficits in mice and humans.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Age increases the risk for cognitive impairment and is the single major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly.

Here we also found evidence that aging DPP6-KO mutants show additional changes related to Alzheimer's disease. We used in vivo MRI to show reduced size of the DPP6-KO brain and hippocampus. Aging DPP6-KO hippocampi contained fewer total neurons and greater neuron death and had diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease present including accumulation of amyloid &#946; and APP and increase in expression of hyper-phosphorylated tau. The amyloid &#946; and phosphorylated tau pathologies were associated with neuroinflammation characterized by increases in microglia and astrocytes. And levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines increased in aging DPP6-KO mice. We finally show that aging DPP6-KO mice display circadian dysfunction, a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Together these results indicate that aging DPP6-KO mice show symptoms of enhanced neurodegeneration reminiscent of dementia associated with a novel structure resulting from synapse loss and neuronal death. This study continues our laboratory's work in discerning the function of DPP6 and here provides compelling evidence of a direct role of DPP6 in Alzheimer's disease.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36209948': {'ArticleTitle': \"The novel estrogen receptor modulator STX attenuates Amyloid-&#946; neurotoxicity in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Based on previous evidence that the non-steroidal estrogen receptor modulator STX mitigates the effects of neurotoxic Amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) in vitro, we have evaluated its neuroprotective benefits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

However, the translational validity of APOE4 mouse models for AD-related cognitive impairment remains to be fully determined. The present study investigated the role of both sex and genotype on learning and memory in aged, humanized APOE knock-in mice. Aged (23.27 mo &#177; 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Task-related metrics were analyzed using two-way sex by genotype ANOVAs. Sex differences were more prominent relative to APOE genotype. Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only APOE4/4 females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that APOE4, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD. Last, there was a very high degree of variability in behavioral performance across APOE genotypes. A cluster analysis of the behavioral data revealed a low-activity and a high-activity cluster. APOE4 carriers were overrepresented in the low-activity cluster, while male:female distributions did not differ.

The logopenic variant, characterized by impairments of word retrieval and sentence repetition along with preserved semantic, syntactic, and motor speech abilities, is the most recently described and remains less understood than other variants due to a comparatively small number of case studies and a lack of investigations with a thorough specification. In this article, we report a 2-year follow-up case study of a 74-year-old Chinese female patient with a logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including its neurolinguistic study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-Positron emission tomography imaging analyses, as well as gene sequencing. This case confirms that, in addition to word-finding and sentence repetition difficulties, the logopenic variant may also present with mild auditory comprehension and naming deficits attributed to impaired access to lexical representations.

The intersection of the three datasets (GSE97760, GSE168813, and GSE62402) was used to obtain 21 co-expressed targets in the peripheral blood samples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. Based on the degree algorithm, the top 10 potential core target genes related to these diseases were identified, which included CLEC4D, PROK2, SIGLEC7, PDGFB, PTCRA, ECH1, etc. Two differentially expressed mRNAs, Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) and three colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), were screened in the GSE62402 dataset associated with osteoporosis. Protein-protein rigid docking with ZDOCK revealed that PROK2 and CSF3 could form a stable protein docking model.

Specielt er vi interesseret i systemiske immunologiske forskelle p&#229; patienter med MPN og druser (MPNd) og MPN med normale nethinder (MPNn). Denne afhandling best&#229;r af to overordnede studier. I Studie I, unders&#248;gte vi forekomsten af retinale forandringer associeret med AMD hos 200 patienter med MPN (artikel I). Studie II, omhandlede immunologiske ligheder ved AMD og MPN, og var opdelt i yderligere tre delstudier hvor vi unders&#248;gte hhv. systemiske mark&#248;rer for inflammation, aldring og angiogenese (artikel II, III og IV). Vi unders&#248;gte mark&#248;rerne i fire typer af patienter: nAMD, intermediaer AMD (iAMD), MPNd og MPNn. Unders&#248;gelsen af forskelle mellem MPNd og MPNn, vil g&#248;re det muligt at identificere forandringer i immunsystemet som kunne vaere relevante for AMD-patogenesen. Vi vil endvidere sammenholde resultaterne for patienter med MPN med patienter som har iAMD og nAMD. I studie I (Artikel I) fandt vi at patienter med MPN har en signifikant h&#248;jere praevalens af store druser og AMD tidligere i livet sammenlignet med estimater fra tre store befolkningsunders&#248;gelser.

ENGLISH SUMMARY: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in high-income countries. It is a progressive retinal disease leading to damage of the cells responsible for central vision. The early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic, while late-stage AMD, which is divided into two entities, neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy (GA), both show vision loss, though generally with different progression rates. Drusen and pigmentary abnormalities in the retina characterise early AMD, while nAMD and GA show angiogenesis in and atrophy of the retina, respectively. The aetiology is multifactorial and, in addition to ageing, which is the most significant risk factor for developing AMD, environmental- and genetic risk factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. Research has focused on local changes in the eye where inflammation has been found to play an essential role, but studies also point to systemic alterations and especially systemic inflammation to be involved in the pathogenesis. The Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of haematological cancers with an acquired genetic defect of the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell, characterised by excess haematopoiesis of the myeloid cell lineage. The diseases have been found to evolve in a biological continuum from early cancer state, essential thrombocythemia, over polycythaemia vera (PV), to the advanced myelofibrosis stage (PMF). The symptoms in these patients are often a result of the changes in the blood composition, hyperviscosity, microvascular disturbances, and reduced tissue perfusion. The major causes of morbidity and mortality are thromboembolic- and haemorrhagic events, and leukemic transformation. A group of mutations that drive the MPNs has been identified, e.g., the JAK2V617F mutation, which results in deregulation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway important, for instance, in cell differentiation and survival. A previous large register study has shown that patients with MPNs have an increased risk of neovascular AMD, and a pilot study has shown an increased prevalence of intermediate AMD. We wish to study this further in a larger scale study. Several studies have also shown that systemic inflammation plays an essential role in both the initiation and progression of the malignant cell clone in MPNs. From this knowledge, a \"Human inflammation model\" has been developed. Since then, the MPNs has been used as model diseases for a similar inflammation model for the development of Alzheimer\\'s disease. In this PhD project, we would like to investigate systemic inflammation in relation to drusen presence. We will do this by comparing systemic immunological markers previously investigated in patients with AMD and compare with MPN. We are primarily interested in systemic immunological differences between patients with MPN and drusen (MPNd) and MPN with normal retinas (MPNn). This thesis consists of two main studies. Study I investigated the prevalence of retinal changes associated with AMD and the prevalence of different AMD stages in 200 patients with MPN (paper I). Study II examined immunological similarities between AMD and MPNs. This study was divided into three substudies exploring systemic markers of inflammation, ageing and angiogenesis, respectively. This was done in four types of patients: nAMD, intermediate AMD (iAMD), MPNd and MPNn. Investigating, differences between MPNd and MPNn, will make it possible to identify changes in the immune system, relevant for AMD pathogenesis. Additionally, we will compare patients with MPNs with patients with iAMD and nAMD. In study I (Paper I), we found that patients with MPNs have a significantly higher prevalence of large drusen and consequently AMD from an earlier age compared to the estimates from three large population-based studies. We also found that drusen prevalence was associated with a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicating a higher level of chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with drusen compared to those without drusen. In study II (papers II, III and IV), we found immunological differences between patients with MPNd and MPNn. When we investigated markers of inflammation, we found a higher level of systemic inflammation in MPNd than MPNn. This was indicated by a higher inflammation score (based on levels of pro-inflammatory markers), a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and indications of a deregulated complement system. When examining markers of ageing, we found signs of accelerated immune ageing in MPNd compared to MPNn, shown by more senescent effector memory T cells. Finally, when exploring a marker of angiogenesis, we found a lower CXCR3 expression on monocytes and T cells in nAMD compared to iAMD, MPNd and MPNn, in line with previous studies of nAMD compared to healthy controls. Further, we found decreasing CXCR3 expression over the MPN biological continuum. These studies indicate CXCR3 involvement in both nAMD and PMF, two disease stages characterised by angiogenesis and fibrosis. From the results of this PhD project, we can conclude that the prevalence of drusen and AMD is increased in patients with MPN compared to the general population. Further, our results show that systemic inflammation may play a far more essential role in AMD pathogenesis than previously anticipated. We, therefore, propose an AMD model (Figure&#160;18) where inflammation can initiate and accelerate the normal age-dependent accumulation of debris in the retina, which later evolve into drusen, resulting in increased local inflammation, and over time early- and intermediate AMD. This results in the increased risk of developing the late debilitating stages of AMD.', 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36200249': {'ArticleTitle': \"Evaluation of the mechanism of action of rosemary volatile oil in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and network pharmacology.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Objective The aim of our study was to investigate the active components and mechanism of action of rosemary volatile oil for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using network pharmacology. Methods We obtained the constituents of the rosemary volatile oil by searching Chinese herbal systemic pharmacological databases and analytical platforms, and we constructed the constituent-target networks by predicting and screening the action targets of the rosemary volatile oil constituents using SwissTargetPrediction, metaTarFisher, and Pubchem. We obtained the AD-related targets using the Genecards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases, and we constructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) using the STRING database in Venny 2.1.0 graph to screen the cross-targets by screening the core-acting targets.

To explore this, we assessed bulk and single-nuclear RNA sequencing data sets generated from four human derived myeloid cell populations: post-mortem microglial nuclei, peripheral monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglial-like cells (MGLs). We found that expression of AD risk genes, gene signatures associated with the inflammatory response in AD, and genes related to proinflammatory immune responses were enriched in microglial nuclei isolated from aged female donors without ante-mortem neurological disease, relative to those from males. In addition, these inflammation-associated gene sets were found to be enriched in peripheral monocytes isolated from postmenopausal women and in MDMs obtained from premenopausal individuals relative to age-matched males. Expression of these gene sets did not differ in MDMs derived from women whose blood was sampled across the menstrual cycle or in MGLs cultured with 17&#946;-oestradiol.

The high blood-brain barrier penetration ability of MSC-EVs-SHP2 is demonstrated in AD-mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC-EVs-SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model.

They have many important functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the maintenance of glutamate and ion homeostasis, the elimination of oxidative stress, energy storage in glycogen, tissue repair, regulating synaptic activity by releasing neurotransmitters, and participating in synaptic formation. Astrocytes have special highly ramified structure. Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels. The ideal location of astrocytes enables them to sense the weak changes of their surroundings and provide the structural basis for the energy supply of neurons. Neurons and astrocytes are closely coupled units of energy metabolism in the brain. Neurons consume a lot of ATPs in the process of neurotransmission. Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates for neurons, maintain high activity of neuron, and facilitate information transmission of neurons. This article reviews the characteristics of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of astrocytes.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of AD (Ncases: 21982; Ncontrols: 41944), blood CD33 mRNA level, the plasma CD33 protein level, and CD33 expression on immune-cell subtypes were obtained from GWASs conducted in the European population.

However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with \"AD-type\" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer\\'s disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P&#160;<&#160;0.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing. For example, variants in SORL1 and TPCN1 showed trends for association with LATE-NC whereas Lewy body pathology trended toward association with USP6NL and BIN1 gene variants.

Conversely, PQR530 which exhibits better brain exposure and superior pharmacokinetic properties, reduced tau pathology even when the treatment started after the onset of pathology. Our results show that dosing animals twice per week with PQR530 resulted in intermittent, rather than sustained target engagement. Nevertheless, this pulse-like mTOR inhibition followed by longer intervals of re-activation was sufficient to reduce tau pathology in the cerebral cortex in P301S tau transgenic mice.

We studied one such model, designated APP/PS1, and found that mutation of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Mer or its ligand Gas6 greatly exacerbated early death. Lethality was tied to violent seizures that appeared to initiate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, where Mer plays an essential role in the microglial phagocytosis of both apoptotic and newborn cells normally generated during adult neurogenesis. We found that newborn DG neurons and excitatory synapses between the DG and the cornu ammonis field 3 (CA3) field of the hippocampus were increased in TAM-deficient mice, and that premature death and adult neurogenesis in these mice were coincident. In contrast, the incidence of lethal seizures and the deposition of dense-core amyloid plaques were strongly anticorrelated.

It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies.

The risk/benefit ratio of high-clearance immunotherapies in early AD is so far questionable after 18 months.

Herein, we identified a bioavailable 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug, sulfanegen, which is able to pose as a sacrificial redox substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), one of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes in the brain. Sulfanegen is able to mitigate toxicity emanating from oxidative insults and the A&#946;1-42 peptide by releasing H2S through the 3MST pathway.

The inconsistent findings regarding the association between SD and incident dementia may be attributable to the neuropathological heterogeneity underlying SD.

A&#946;42 can undergo abnormal aggregation and amyloidogenesis in the brain, forming fibrillar plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The insoluble fibrillar forms of A&#946;42 exhibit well-defined, cross &#946;-sheet structures at the molecular level and are less toxic than the soluble, intermediate disordered oligomeric forms. However, the mechanism of initial interaction of monomers and subsequent oligomerization is not well understood. The structural disorder of A&#946;42 adds to the challenges of determining the structural properties of its monomers, making it difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenic aggregation. Certain regions of A&#946;42 are known to exhibit helical propensity in different physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopy has shown that the A&#946;42 monomer at lower pH can adopt an &#945;-helical conformation and as the pH is increased, the peptide switches to &#946;-sheet conformation and aggregation occurs. CD spectroscopy studies of aggregation have shown the presence of an initial spike in the amount of &#945;-helical content at the start of aggregation. Such an increase in &#945;-helical content suggests a mechanism wherein the peptide can expose critical non-polar residues for interaction, leading to hydrophobic aggregation with other interacting peptides. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize in detail the conformational landscape of monomeric A&#946;42 in solution to identify molecular properties that may mediate the early stages of oligomerization. We hypothesized that conformations with &#945;-helical structure have a higher probability of initiating aggregation because they increase the hydrophobicity of the peptide.

Importantly, for the first time &#945;-helical conformations are observed to increase the exposure of aromatic and hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, favoring their hydrophobically driven interaction with other monomers to initiate aggregation.

Methods: 18-F MK-6240 scans from 102 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders) were reviewed by an expert nuclear medicine physician blind to participants' diagnosis to identify common patterns of brain uptake. This initial visual read method was field tested in a separate, non-overlapping cohort of 102 participants with 2 additional na&#239;ve readers trained on the method. Visual read outcomes were compared with semiquantitative assessments using volume of interest (VOI) SUVr. Results: For the visual read eight gray-matter regions per hemisphere were assessed as negative (no abnormal uptake) or positive (1-25% of the region involved, 25-75% involvement, or >75% involvement), then characterized the tau binding pattern as positive or negative for evidence of tau, and if positive, whether brain uptake is in an AD pattern.

Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of Nsp1 in manipulating host translation, which can be leveraged for combating age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people worldwide and currently without effective treatment.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36170055': {'ArticleTitle': 'Computationally Elucidating the Binding Kinetics for Different AChE Inhibitors to Access the Rationale for Improving the Drug Efficacy.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Traditional drug discovery is based on a binding affinity (thermodynamics)-driven paradigm. Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (koff). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between mAChE and TcAChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either TcAChE or mAChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with mAChE than TcAChE.

AD patients had increased extracellular amyloid &#946; plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons. Recent studies have shown an association between the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) and AD. The involvement of RAS has been mediated through Angiotensin II (AngII), which is overexpressed in aging brains. However, the exact mechanism of how AngII contributes to AD is unknown. Thus, we hypothesize that AngII increases p-tau by activating its kinases, CDK5 and MAPK. In the human cortical neuron cell line, HCN2, treatment with AngII upregulated the gene expression of CDK5 (2.9 folds, p&#160;<&#160;0.0001) and MAPTK (1.9 folds, p&#160;<&#160;0.001). The AT1R antagonist, Losartan, blocked the changes in tau kinases. Also, AngII-induced the MAPK activation, increasing its phosphorylation by 400% (p&#160;<&#160;0.0001), an increase that was also blocked by Losartan. An increase in p-tau by AngII was observed using fluorescent microscopy.

The presence of adiponectin and its receptor in the brain with its unique anti-diabetic effects and association with neurodegenerative diseases has raised our interest in exploring orally active small molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon. To date, all the available drugs for the treatment of AD provides symptomatic relief and do not stall the progression of the disease. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent to find appropriate targets. Here, we attempt to shed lights on adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon and its downstream molecular targets in reducing disease pathogenesis and insulin resistance. In brain, AdipoRon induced AMPK activation, increased insulin sensitivity, reduced amyloid beta plaque deposition and improved cognitive impairment. Levels of BACE were also downregulated while LDLR, APOE and neprilysin were upregulated promoting amyloid beta clearance from brain. AdipoRon further reduced the chronic inflammatory marker, GFAP and improved synaptic markers PSD-95 and synaptophysin in APP/PS1 mice. Our in-vitro studies further confirmed the potential role of AdipoRon in improving insulin sensitivity by increasing GLUT 4 translocation, glucose uptake and insulin signaling under hyperinsulinemic condition.

The changes in amyloid pathology are accompanied by robust microglial and astrocytic hypertrophy, which suggest a protective glial response that may limit amyloid plaque development in G protein-biased GPR3 AD mice.

Previous studies have used nonpolarizable force fields to study A&#946;, providing some insight into how this protein unfolds. However, nonpolarizable force fields have fixed charges that lack the ability to redistribute in response to changes in local electric fields. Here, we performed polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on the full-length A&#946;42 of WT and FAD mutations and calculated folding free energies of the A&#946;15-27 fragment via umbrella sampling. By studying both the full-length A&#946;42 and a fragment containing mutations and the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17-21), we were able to systematically study how these FAD mutations impact secondary and tertiary structure and the thermodynamics of folding. Electrostatic interactions, including those between permanent and induced dipoles, affected side-chain properties, salt bridges, and solvent interactions. The FAD mutations resulted in shifts in the electronic structure and solvent accessibility at the central hydrophobic cluster and the hydrophobic C-terminal region. Using umbrella sampling, we found that the folding of the WT and E22 mutants is enthalpically driven, whereas the D23N mutant is entropically driven, arising from a different unfolding pathway and peptide-bond dipole response. Together, the unbiased, full-length, and umbrella sampling simulations of fragments reveal that the FAD mutations perturb nearby residues and others in hydrophobic regions to potentially alter solubility.

A photothermally assisted photo-oxygenation treatment based on PCN@ICG could largely enhance the photo-inhibition effect on A&#946;42 aggregation and lead to much lower neurotoxicity upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation at 808 nm compared with a single modality of photo-treatment in both cell-free and in vitro experiments. Generally, local photothermal heat increases the instability of A&#946; aggregates and keeps A&#946; in the status of monomers, which facilitates the photo-oxygenation process of generating oxidized A&#946; monomers with low aggregation capability. In addition, combined with the brain-targeting peptide RVG, the PCN-222@ICG@RVG nanoprobe shows high permeability of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) on a human brain-on-a-chip platform.

Based on the selected m6A regulators, AD patients could be well classified into two m6A models using consensus clustering. The two clusters of patients had different immune profiles, and m6A regulators were associated with the components of immune cells. Additionally, there were 19 key AD genes obtained by screening differential genes through weighted gene co-expression network and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis, which were highly associated with important m6A regulators during the occurrence of AD. More interestingly, NOTCH2 and NME1 could be potential targets for m6A regulation of AD.

Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated.

The expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs. Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy as an AD biomarker.

Two polymorphisms have implicated ABI3 as a modulator of AD risk. Here, we sought to identify ABI3 isoforms expressed in human AD and non-AD brain, quantify the more abundant isoforms as a function of AD genetics and neuropathology, and provide an initial in vitro characterization of the proteins produced by these novel isoforms. We report that ABI3 expression is increased with AD neuropathology but not associated with AD genetics. Single-cell RNAseq of APP/PS1 mice showed that Abi3 is primarily expressed by microglia, including disease-associated microglia. In human brain, several novel ABI3 isoforms were identified, including isoforms with partial or complete loss of exon 6. Expression of these isoforms correlated tightly with total ABI3 expression but were not influenced by AD genetics. Lastly, we performed an initial characterization of these isoforms in transfected cells and found that, while full-length ABI3 was expressed in a dispersed punctate fashion within the cytosol, isoforms lacking most or all of exon six tended to form extensive protein aggregates. In summary, ABI3 expression is restricted to microglia, is increased with Alzheimer's neuropathology, and includes several isoforms that display a variable tendency to aggregate when expressed in vitro.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36140732': {'ArticleTitle': \"Gut Microbiome and Mycobiome Alterations in an In Vivo Model of Alzheimer's Disease.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Gut microbiota has emerged as an important key regulator of health and disease status. Indeed, gut microbial dysbiosis has been identified in an increasing number of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, microbial alterations have been reported also in Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting possible pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to the development of specific AD hallmarks and exacerbating metabolic alterations and neuroinflammation. The identification of these mechanisms is crucial to develop novel, targeted therapies and identify potential biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. Thus, the possibility to have AD in vivo models to study this microbial ecosystem represents a great opportunity for translational applications. Here, we characterized both gut microbiome and mycobiome of 3xTg-AD mice, one of the most widely used AD models, to identify specific microbial alterations with respect to the wild-type counterpart. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction of the Coprococcus and an increased abundance of Escherichia_Shigella and Barnesiella genera in the AD mice compatible with a pro-inflammatory status and the development of AD-related pathogenetic features. Moreover, the fungal Dipodascaceae family was significantly increased, thus suggesting a possible contribution to the metabolic alterations found in AD.

The individual level SNP-QT signals are high dimensional and typically have small effect sizes, making them hard to be detected and replicated. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new approach that identifies high-level imaging genetic associations through applying multigraph clustering to the SNP-QT association maps. Given an SNP set and a brain QT set, the association between each SNP and each QT is evaluated using a linear regression model. Based on the resulting SNP-QT association map, five SNP-SNP similarity networks (or graphs) are created using five different scoring functions, respectively. Multigraph clustering is applied to these networks to identify SNP clusters with similar association patterns with all the brain QTs. After that, functional annotation is performed for each identified SNP cluster and its corresponding brain association pattern. We applied this pipeline to an AD imaging genetic study, which yielded promising results. For example, in an association study between 54 AD SNPs and 116 amyloid QTs, we identified two SNP clusters with one responsible for amyloid beta clearances and the other regulating amyloid beta formation. These high-level findings have the potential to provide valuable insights into relevant genetic pathways and brain circuits, which can help form new hypotheses for more detailed imaging and genetics studies in independent cohorts.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36140138': {'ArticleTitle': \"The Feasibility of Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using a Neural Network Hybrid Platform.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for disease prevention and cure.

Here, we demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD diagnosis approach using the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) fingerprints of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). SERS and CNN were combined for biomarker detection to analyze disease-associated biochemical changes in the CSF. We achieved very high reproducibility in double-blind experiments for testing the feasibility of our system on human samples. We achieved an overall accuracy of 92% (100% for normal individuals and 88.9% for AD individuals) based on the clinical diagnosis. Further, we observed an excellent correlation coefficient between our test score and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score.

The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1a) has been shown to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons. Thus far, the roles of PGC-1a in Alzheimer's disease and its potential value for restoring mitochondrial dysfunction remain largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the impacts of PGC-1a on AD pathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction and its potential mechanisms with a particular focus on mitochondrial dynamics. Paralleling AD-related pathological deposits, neuronal apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and lowered membrane potential, a remarkable reduction in the expression of PGC-1a was shown in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice at 6 months of age. By infusing AAV-Ppargc1&#945; into the lateral parietal association (LPtA) cortex of the APP/PS1 brain, we found that PGC-1a ameliorated AD-like behavioral abnormalities, such as deficits in spatial reference memory, working memory and sensorimotor gating. Notably, overexpressed PGC-1a in LPtA rescued mitochondrial swelling and damage in neurons, likely through correcting the altered balance in mitochondrial fission-fusion and its abnormal distribution. Our findings support the notion that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics is likely an important mechanism that leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and AD-related pathological and cognitive impairments, and they indicate the potential value of PGC-1a for restoring mitochondrial dynamics as an innovative therapeutic target for AD.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36139395': {'ArticleTitle': \"Increased KV2.1 Channel Clustering Underlies the Reduction of Delayed Rectifier K+ Currents in Hippocampal Neurons of the Tg2576 Alzheimer's Disease Mouse.\", 'ArticleAbstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. Cortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability intervenes in the pathological derangement of brain activity leading to cognitive decline. As key regulators of neuronal excitability, the voltage-gated K+ channels (KV) might play a crucial role in the AD pathophysiology. Among them, the KV2.1 channel, the main &#945; subunit mediating the delayed rectifier K+ currents (IDR) and controlling the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, has been poorly examined in AD. In the present study, we investigated the KV2.1 protein expression and activity in hippocampal neurons from the Tg2576 mouse, a widely used transgenic model of AD. To this aim we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our Western blotting results reveal that KV2.1 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice and in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 mouse embryos compared with the WT counterparts. Electrophysiological experiments unveiled that the whole IDR were reduced in the Tg2576 primary neurons compared with the WT neurons, and that this reduction was due to the loss of the KV2.1 current component. Moreover, we found that the reduction of the KV2.1-mediated currents was due to increased channel clustering, and that glutamate, a stimulus inducing KV2.1 declustering, was able to restore the IDR to levels comparable to those of the WT neurons. These findings add new information about the dysregulation of ionic homeostasis in the Tg2576 AD mouse model and identify KV2.1 as a possible player in the AD-related alterations of neuronal excitability.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36139364': {'ArticleTitle': 'Demand Coupling Drives Neurodegeneration: A Model of Age-Related Cognitive Decline and Dementia.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'The societal burden of Alzheimer\\'s Disease (AD) and other major forms of dementia continues to grow, and multiple pharmacological agents directed towards modifying the pathological \"hallmarks\" of AD have yielded disappointing results. Though efforts continue towards broadening and deepening our knowledge and understanding of the mechanistic and neuropathological underpinnings of AD, our previous failures motivate a re-examination of how we conceptualize AD pathology and progression. In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the risk and progression of AD. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence indicates that lifestyle and environment represent the ultimate level of causation for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, the decline in cognitive demands over the lifespan plays a central role in driving the structural and functional deteriorations of the brain. In the absence of adequate cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity. In this setting, the heterogeneity of associated neuropathological tissue hallmarks then occurs as a consequence of an individual\\'s genetic and environmental background and are best considered downstream markers of the disease process rather than specific targets for direct intervention.

Coronal hippocampal organotypic brain slices (170 &#181;m) were prepared from postnatal (day 8-10) C57BL6 wild-type mice. Collagen hydrogels loaded with P301S aggregated tau were applied to slices and the spread of tau was assessed by immunohistochemistry after 8 weeks in culture. Collagen hydrogels prove to be an effective protein delivery system subject to natural degradation in 14 days and they release tau proteins up to 8 weeks. Slices with un- and hyperphosphorylated P301S aggregated tau demonstrate significant spreading to the ventral parts of the hippocampal slices compared to empty collagen hydrogels after 8 weeks. Moreover, the spread of P301S aggregated tau occurs in a time-dependent manner, which was interrupted when the neuroanatomical pathways are lesioned. We illustrate that the spreading of tau can be investigated in organotypic slice cultures using collagen hydrogels to achieve a localized application and slow release of tau proteins.

Precisely, a dysfunction in metabotropic GABAB receptor signalling through G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK or Kir3) channels on the hippocampus has been postulated. Thus, we determined the impact of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) pathology in GIRK channel density, subcellular distribution, and its association with GABAB receptors in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from the APP/PS1 mouse model using quantitative SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labelling (SDS-FRL) and proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA). In wild type mice, single SDS-FRL detection revealed a similar dendritic gradient for GIRK1 and GIRK2 in CA1 pyramidal cells, with higher densities in spines, and GIRK3 showed a lower and uniform distribution. Double SDS-FRL showed a co-clustering of GIRK2 and GIRK1 in post- and presynaptic compartments, but not for GIRK2 and GIRK3. Likewise, double GABAB1 and GIRK2 SDS-FRL detection displayed a high degree of co-clustering in nanodomains (40-50 nm) mostly in spines and axon terminals. In APP/PS1 mice, the density of GIRK2 and GIRK1, but not for GIRK3, was significantly reduced along the neuronal surface of CA1 pyramidal cells and in axon terminals contacting them. Importantly, GABAB1 and GIRK2 co-clustering was not present in APP/PS1 mice. Similarly, P-LISA experiments revealed a significant reduction in GABAB1 and GIRK2 interaction on the hippocampus of this animal model. Overall, our results provide compelling evidence showing a significant reduction on the cell surface density of pre- and postsynaptic GIRK1 and GIRK2, but not GIRK3, and a decline in GABAB receptors and GIRK2 channels co-clustering in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from APP/PS1 mice, thus suggesting that a disruption in the GABAB receptor-GIRK channel membrane assembly causes dysregulation in the GABAB signalling via GIRK channels in this AD animal model.\", 'query': 'Alzheimer'}, '36131298': {'ArticleTitle': 'Letter to the editor on a paper by Kaivola et al.

Colombia has the largest human group known to have familial AD (FAD). This group carries the autosomal dominant and fully penetrant mutation E280A in PSEN1, which causes early-onset AD. Recently, our group identified an E280A carrier who did not develop FAD. The individual was homozygous for the Christchurch mutation R136S in APOE3 (APOEch). Remarkably, APOE is the main genetic risk factor for developing sporadic AD (SAD) and most of cerebral ApoE is produced by astroglia.

There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis.

Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]).

Aerobic exercise (AE) enhances learning and memory, improves cognitive impairment, increases telomere binding protein expression, and decreases apoptosis regulators, but it remains unclear whether it can improve cognitive impairment caused by neuronal apoptosis in AD. Therefore, this study investigated whether an 8-week running table exercise intervention could reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in the hippocampal neurons of AD model mice. After the exercise intervention, we evaluated the learning memory ability (positioning, navigation, and spatial search) of mice using a Morris water labyrinth, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and protein application to detect hippocampal PI3K/Akt/GSK-3&#946; signaling pathway protein and hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and apoptosis-promoting protein bcl-2-related X (Bax) protein expression. The results showed that aerobic exercise improved the location and spatial exploration ability of mice, increased the number of PI3K- and p-Akt-positive cells, increased the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and bcl-2 proteins, decreased the expression of GSK-3&#946; and Bax proteins, and increased the bcl-2/Bax ratio of mice. The results suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in AD mice.

In the subiculum (SUB), FA, axial diffusivity (D||) and radial kurtosis (K&#9524;) were significantly higher in 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. Morphological quantification of A&#223;1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity showed elevated A&#223; and tau in the Fi, ventral hippocampus (HV) and SUB of 3xTg-AD mice. The presence of A&#946; and tau was significantly correlated with several DT and DK measures, particularly in the SUB, where an increase in tau correlated with an increase in mean kurtosis (MK) and K&#9524;. This work demonstrates significant dMRI differences between older 3xTg-AD and NC mice in the hippocampus and Fi. Significant correlations were found between dMRI and morphological measures of A&#946; and tau pathology. These results support the potential of dMRI-derived parameters as biomarkers of AD pathology.

The neural basis of these functions in PSP and bvFTD groups, by analysis of structural neuroimaging, were also investigated. Twenty-three bvFTD patients, 21 PSP patients and 23 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent 3T brain MRI and a full cognitive exam including the short version of Social and Emotional Assessment (Mini-SEA), which is composed of a facial emotion recognition test (FERT) and the faux pas test. Two components of the faux pas test were distinguished: a score assessing the recognition of social norms violation and a score assessing mentalizing. Compared to controls, bvFTD and PSP patients had significantly reduced scores in all tests of social cognition but did not differ on these measures. PSP and bvFTD had cerebral atrophy in critical regions for social cognition processes, when compared to controls. The cortical correlates of emotion recognition partially overlapped in bvFTD and PSP, with correlations retrieved within the frontal medial cortex, cingulate, insula and limbic structures. PSP and bvFTD patients also displayed similar patterns of brain correlations for the composite score of social norms, with a significant cluster in anterior temporal lobes. Mentalizing scores were associated with frontal and temporal poles bilaterally, in both bvFTD and PSP.

PP2A is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP2A C&#945;/&#946;) and scaffolding subunit (PP2A A&#945;/&#946;) and various substrate-directing B regulatory subunits. PP2A biogenesis is regulated at multiple levels. For example, the sequestration of the free catalytic subunit during the process of biogenesis avoids promiscuous phosphatase activity. Post-translational modifications of PP2A C directs PP2A heterotrimeric formation. Additionally, PP2A functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, where attenuated PP2A enzymatic activity creates a permissive environment for oncogenic transformation. Recent work studying PP2A in cancer showed that its role in tumorigenesis is more nuanced, with some holoenzymes being tumor suppressive, while others are required for oncogenic transformation. In cancer biology, PP2A function is modulated through various mechanisms including the displacement of specific B regulatory subunits by DNA tumor viral antigens, by recurrent mutations, and through loss of carboxymethyl-sensitive heterotrimeric complexes. In aggregate, these alterations bias PP2A activity away from its tumor suppressive functions and towards oncogenic ones. From a therapeutic perspective, molecular glues, and disruptors present opportunities for both the selective stabilization of tumor suppressive holoenzymes and disruption of holoenzymes that are pro-oncogenic.

Differential analysis revealed that UCHL5 expressed highly in tumors versus normal tissues, like TCGA-PAAD, GSE28735, GSE15471 and collected samples. Patients with high UCHL5 expressions had worse survival outcomes relative to those with low UCHL5 levels. Experimental assays showed that UCHL5 overexpression could significantly enhance cell proliferation, colony formation and self-renewal capacities. UCHL5 could also promote PAAD migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UCHL5 could directly deubiquitinate and stabilize ELK3 proteins. UCHL5 relied on accumulated ELK3 proteins to drive cell growth, stem-like properties and migration abilities. In addition, enrichment analysis based on RNA-seq data implicated that ELK3 mainly correlated with Notch1 signaling and ELK3 could notably elevate ELK3 mRNA levels. UCHL5 could thus promote self-renewal abilities of PAAD and targeting ELK3 could inhibit the stemness features.

However, the role and mechanism of aberrant autophagy in ovarian cancer remains unclear. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the most important pathway for specific protein degradation. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) have crucial roles in all the stages of tumorigenesis and progression. Herein, we explore the DUBs which contribute to aberrant autophagy in ovarian cancer. TCGA data analysis shows that the autophagy level is suppressed, and the selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 is abnormally high expressed in ovarian cancer. We screen and identify that the deubiquitinase PSMD14 negatively regulates autophagy level. Functional studies show that increased PSMD14 expression remarkably enhances ovarian cancer cells malignancy, whereas knockdown of PSMD14 has the opposite effect. Furthermore, in vivo assays show that knockdown of PSMD14 inhibits the growth, lung and abdominal metastasis of ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, PSMD14 directly interacts with LRPPRC and inhibits its ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting autophagy through LRPPRC/Beclin1-Bcl-2/SQSTM1 signaling pathway. Next, we demonstrate that PSMD14 is upregulated in ovarian cancer and high expression of PSMD14 positively correlates with LRPPRC.

However, the heterogeneity and characteristics of the ATC-associated macrophages (ATAMs) in ATC remain far from clear. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis and gene expression microarray datasets to assess the molecular signature of ATAMs. Compared with normal thyroid-associated macrophages (NTAMs), 778 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly changed in ATAMs compared with NTAMs. These DEGs were correlated with oxidative phosphorylation (M2 phenotype) and phagocytosis (M1 phenotype). Moreover, ATAMs highly expressed pro-tumor genes associated with angiogenesis, fibrosis, metalloprotease activity, and metastasis. Notably, we identified one ATC-specific subset, IL2RA+ VSIG4+ ATAMs, co-expressed M1 and M2 markers. The infiltration of IL2RA+ VSIG4+ ATAMs showed strong correlation with BRAF and RAS signaling, and its high infiltration was associated with favorable prognosis in thyroid-cancer patients. IL2RA+ VSIG4+ ATAMs were associated with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (B cells, CD8+ T cells, Tregs).

The mechanisms underlying pain during CIN are starting to be uncovered. Neuroimaging allows the identification of brain circuitry involved in pain processing and modulation and has recently been used to unravel the disruptions of that circuitry by neuropathic pain. The present study evaluates the effects of paclitaxel, a cytostatic drug frequently used in cancer treatment, at the neuronal function in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus and periaqueductal grey (PAG) using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). We also studied the metabolic profile at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus using ex vivo spectroscopy. Wistar male rats were intraperitoneal injected with paclitaxel or vehicle solution (DMSO). The evaluation of mechanical sensitivity using von Frey test at baseline (BL), 21 (T21), 28 (T28), 49 (T49) and 56 days (T56) after CIN induction showed that paclitaxel-injected rats presented mechanical hypersensitivity from T21 until T56 after CIN induction. The evaluation of the locomotor activity and exploratory behaviors using open-field test at T28 and T56 after the first injection of paclitaxel revealed that paclitaxel-injected rats walked higher distance with higher velocity at late point of CIN accompanied with a sustained exhibition of anxiety-like behaviors. Imaging studies performed using MEMRI at T28 and T56 showed that paclitaxel treatment increased the neuronal activation in the hypothalamus and PAG at T56 in comparison with the control group. The analysis of data from ex vivo spectroscopy demonstrated that at T28 paclitaxel-injected rats presented an increase of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in the PFC and an increase of NAA and decrease of lactate (Lac) concentration in the hypothalamus compared to the control group. Furthermore, at T56 the paclitaxel-injected rats presented lower NAA and higher taurine (Tau) levels in the PFC.

However, a critical bottleneck still lies in exploring simple and controllable methods to synthesize noble metal chalcogenides especially PtS for in vivo photo-induced cancer imaging and simultaneous therapy. Herein, we proposed the albumin-templated synthesis of size-controllable platinum (II) sulfide nanodots (PtS-NDs) for multimodal cancer imaging and potent photothermal therapy. PtS-NDs were precisely synthesized with a tunable size ranging from 2.1 nm to 4.5 nm through a thermodynamically controlled growth inside albumin nanocages. PtS-NDs yielded significant near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and outstanding photothermal conversion under NIR laser irradiation, as well as effective resistance to photobleaching, thereby generating remarkable in vivo photoacoustic signals and distinct hyperthermia at tumor site. Moreover, these nanodots possessed efficient cellular uptake and tumor targeting capabilities in a size-dependent manner, thus leading to controllable diagnostic and thermo-therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, PtS-NDs with core diameter of 4.5 nm displayed preferable in vivo photoacoustic and CT imaging with high sensitivity, spatially and anatomically enhanced imaging contrast, together with hyperthermia mediated tumor ablation. Thus, the albumin-templated biomimetic synthesis provided an insightful strategy on fabricating theranostic PtS-NDs for potential clinical applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Noble metal chalcogenides especially PtS are of particular importance in the field of precise nanomedicine to improve both accuracy of cancer diagnosis and efficiency of tumor treatment. However, the intensively preclinical investigation of PtS was limited due to the lack of simple and controllable synthetic methods. Here, we report an albumin-templated biomineralization synthesis of platinum (II) sulfide nanodots (PtS-NDs). Specifically, albumin-templated biomineralization of PtS-NDs was induced by the electrostatic interactions between albumin and Pt2+, followed by the nucleation and growth inside the albumin nanocages. The resulting PtS-NDs showed good dispersibility and biosafety, as well as size-dependent photophysical properties and biological behaviors.

Here, via engineered extracellular matrices, we observed that the development of mature FAs, coupled with a symmetrical pattern of radial fiber bundles, appeared at the right-angle vertices in cells with square shape. While circular cells aligned the transverse fibers parallel to the cell edge, and moved them centripetally in a counter-clockwise direction, symmetrical bundles of radial fibers at the vertices of square cells disrupted the counter-clockwise swirling and bridged the transverse fibers to move centripetally. In square cells, the contractile force, generated by the myosin IIA-enriched transverse fibers, were concentrated and transmitted outwards along the symmetrical bundles of radial fibers, to the extracellular matrix through FAs, and thereby driving FA organization and maturation. The symmetrical radial fiber bundles concentrated the transverse fibers contractility inward to the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope. The tauter cytoskeletal network adjusted the nuclear-actomyosin force balance to cause nuclear deformability and to increase nuclear translocation of the transcription co-activator YAP, which in turn modulated the switch in MSC commitment. Thus, FAs dynamically respond to geometric cues and remodel actin cytoskeletal network to re-distribute intracelluar tension towards the cell nucleus, and thereby controlling YAP mechanotransduction signaling in regulating MSC fate decision. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We decipher how cellular mechanics is self-organized depending on extracellular geometric features to correlate with mesenchymal stromal cell lineage commitment. In response to geometry constrains on cell morphology, symmetrical radial fiber bundles are assembled and clustered depending on the maturation state of focal adhesions and bridge with the transverse fibers, and thereby establishing the dynamic cytoskeletal network. Contractile force, generated by the myosin-IIA-enriched transverse fibers, is transmitted and dynamically drives the retrograde movement of the actin cytoskeletal network, which appropriately adjusts the nuclear-actomyosin force balance and deforms the cell nucleus for YAP mechano-transduction signaling in regulating mesenchymal stromal cell fate decision.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36328118': {'ArticleTitle': 'Interleukin-11 (IL11) inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a multifactorial wasting syndrome characterized by loss of skeletal muscle. Interleukin-11 (IL11), one of the IL6 family cytokines, is highly expressed in various types of cancer including cancers frequently associated with cachexia. However, the impact of IL11 on muscle metabolism remains to be determined. Since one of the mechanisms of muscle wasting in cachexia is defective muscle regeneration due to impaired myogenic differentiation, we examined the effect of IL11 on the differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Treatment of C2C12 cells with recombinant mouse IL11 resulted in decreased myotube formation. In addition, IL11 treatment reduced the protein and mRNA levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC), a marker of myogenic differentiation. Moreover, the levels of myogenic regulatory factors including myogenin and Mrf4 were significantly reduced by IL11 treatment. IL11 treatment increased the number of BrdU-positive cells and the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, while the levels of p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 were reduced by IL11 treatment in differentiating C2C12 cells, suggesting that IL11 interferes with cell cycle exit during the early stages of myogenic differentiation. Consistent with this, IL11 treatment at the late stage of differentiation did not affect myotube formation and MHC expression. IL11 treatment resulted in an activation of ERK, STAT3, and AKT in differentiating C2C12 cells. However, only ERK inhibitors including PD98059 and U0126 were able to ameliorate the suppressive effect of IL11 on the expression of MHC and myogenin. Additionally, pretreatment with PD98059 and U0126 resulted in improved myotube formation and reduced BrdU staining in IL11-treated cells. Together, our results suggest that IL11 inhibits myogenic differentiation through delayed cell cycle exit in an ERK-dependent manner.

Among the 8260 trials for 954 new anticancer drugs identified, China was involved in 8&#183;8% of the trials and with 20&#183;4% of the drugs being trialled. These participation rates are significantly lower than those for South Korea (14&#183;5% of trials and 36&#183;3% of drugs), Japan (16&#183;1% of trials and 38&#183;7% of drugs), the EU (40&#183;6% of trials and 67&#183;7% of drugs), and the USA (65&#183;7% of trials and 91&#183;2% of drugs; p<0&#183;0001 for all). Similar results were found for the synchronous participation rate, defined as the proportion of drugs or trials at the highest development stage internationally, for the 803 tested drugs, which ranged from 9&#183;0% in China to 87&#183;7% in the USA. China's participation rate in early phase trials (4&#183;4%) and in synchronous trials (5&#183;4%) was even lower, in stark contrast to that of the USA (66&#183;1% for early phase trials and 89&#183;1% for synchronous trials). The fastest growing annual rate of participation in trials was observed in China (15&#183;7%), followed by South Korea (8&#183;2%) and Japan (6&#183;8%); no change was detected in the USA or the EU.

Although bilateral neck exploration is traditionally the standard method for surgery, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP), or focused parathyroidectomy, has been widely accepted with comparable curative outcomes. For successful MIP, accurate preoperative localization of parathyroid lesions is essential. However, no consensus exists on the optimal approach for localization. Currently, ultrasonography and technetium-99m-sestamibi-single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography are widely accepted in most cases. However, exact localization cannot always be achieved, especially in cases with multiglandular disease, ectopic glands, recurrent disease, and normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, new modalities for preoperative localization have been developed and evaluated. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography and parathyroid venous sampling have demonstrated improvements in sensitivity and accuracy. Both anatomical and functional information can be obtained by combining these methods. As each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, the localization study should be deliberately chosen based on each patient's clinical profile, costs, radiation exposure, and the availability of experienced experts.

Yet, how this occurs and whether transfer of oxidative equivalents to the mitochondrion is required remain unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of the ETC drives reversal of the mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (GOT2) as well as malate and succinate dehydrogenases (MDH2 and SDH) to transfer oxidative NAD+ equivalents into the mitochondrion. This supports the NAD+-dependent activity of the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and thereby enables anaplerosis-the entry of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle and connected biosynthetic pathways.

In this context, dealing with MIPs synthesis for bio-macromolecules detection/extraction, one of the critical steps in ensuring effective binding affinity for the parent molecule is the selection of suitable epitopes for pCAs imprinting. To address this challenge, here we investigated the ability of lysine (K) residues to trigger the epitope imprinting process into a polynorepinephrine (PNE) matrix. To this aim, we first designed a set of model epitopes composed of three K and six alanine (A) residues to investigate the influence of each 'KA' combination on the imprinting process and the resulting binding performance by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Only the case of three flanking K residues in N-terminus arose as an excellent trigger for epitope imprinting. The efficacy of the 3K-tag strategy was then evaluated on two peptide templates belonging to soluble programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1), which is of great interest as a cancer biomarker in liquid biopsies. These templates were selected due to their negligible natural ability to be imprinted into the PNE matrix and were modified with 3K-tags, in N-, C-, and N/C- positions, respectively.

Therefore, we investigated the significance of non-standardized pre-biopsy MRI abnormalities (conditions not in accordance with PI-RADS) and subsequent targeted biopsy. We collected clinicopathological data, including the presence or absence of MRI abnormalities, through biopsies from January 2017 to February 2022 at the Kanagawa Cancer Center and performed statistical analyses. We enrolled in 1086 cases: MRI abnormalities were observed in 861 cases (79.3%). In these 861 cases, the adenocarcinoma detection rate, number of positive cores, and length of the highest Grade Group (GG) lesions were significantly higher. In the multivariate analysis, MRI abnormalities were the most significant factor for detecting adenocarcinoma of &#8805;GG 2 (odds ratio: 4.52, 95% confidence interval: 3.08-6.63). Targeted biopsy showed a higher percentage of positive cores with &#8805;GG2 and longer highest GG lesion lengths than systematic biopsy. Furthermore, the highest GG was upgraded in 109 of 788 cases by targeted biopsy. However, several adenocarcinomas (125/788; 15.9%) could not be detected using only targeted biopsy. Non-standardized MRI abnormalities are powerful predictors of cancer and grading. Targeted biopsies based on MRI abnormalities provide several benefits.

Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are fundamental processes for tumor progression and dissemination, ensuring oxygen and nutrient delivery and supporting one of the most important pathways of tumor dissemination, contributing to metastasis. Thus, our aim was to evaluate whether the expression of molecular biomarkers involved in angiogenic and lymphangiogenic processes influenced CC clinicopathological features and prognosis in patients with MS. Clinical and pathological data of 300 patients submitted to CC surgical resection at a single tertiary hospital were retrospectively retrieved from hospital records. Tumor tissue microarrays of archived paraffin-embedded blocks were used to assess CD31, VEGF-A and D2-40 tissue expression by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of stained area was quantified by computerized morphometric analysis. No association between tissue expression of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis biomarkers and tumor clinical and pathological characteristics was found. However, in subgroup analysis of patients with MS, dysglycemia was associated with lower D2-40 expression (p&#160;=&#160;0.007) and high waist-circumference was associated with higher D2-40 (p&#160;=&#160;0.0029) and VEGF-A expression (p&#160;=&#160;0.026).

The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to analyze the relationship between prognosis and GLUT gene expressions. To investigate the regulatory effect of Rab11s and SREBP2 on GLUTs during tumor progression, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were performed on glioma tissues and the T98G GBM cell line.

Here, we found that SCNN1G was aberrantly downregulated in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) tissues, which showed an efficifent diagnostic value according to the ROC curve analysis. The lower expression of SCNN1G was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis and a worse outcome of HNSCC patients. Ectopic overexpressing SCNN1G inhibited the invasive and migratory abilities of HNSCC cells, while knocking down SCNN1G showed an opposite effect. A positive correlation between SCNN1G and CDH1 expression was observed, which suggested that SCNN1G might impede HNSCC metastasis via strengthing cell-cell adherin. In addition, RAS signaling and ion channel transport signaling were enriched by SCNN1G in HNSCC using GSEA analysis, indicating that these signaling pathways might be the underlying mechanisms for SCNN1G as well.

Briefly, and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine iodide (as an acceptor)-and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (as a donor)-coloaded nanoparticles were administered intravenously to the mice, and imaging was performed using a fluorescence in vivo imager. The fluorescence intensities of images were acquired in the FRET, donor, and acceptor channels, and the nanoparticle kinetics in the tumor region was quantified by compensating for bleed-through. Second, in the cleared tumor tissue of mice, the difference in evaluation properties between the two- and three-dimensional visualization of the nanoparticles was examined. In brief, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-loaded nanoparticles were intravenously administered to the mice after fluorescently labeled tomato lectin treatment to visualize tumor vessels. Excised tumor tissue was cleared and observed using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, and three-dimensional images were reconstructed. The three-dimensional minimum distances traveled by DiI from the tumor vessels were calculated using information about the two-dimensional distance and the slicing position using the Pythagoras theorem.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been implicated in human cancers, and they may also serve as biomarkers of disease progression and prognosis. The miR-17-92 cluster is one of the most widely studied miRNA clusters, which was initially reported as an oncogene, but was later reported to exhibit tumour suppressive effects in some human cancers. This review summarizes the recent progress and context-dependant role of this cluster in various cancers. We summarize the known mechanisms which regulate miR-17-92 expression and molecular pathways that are in turn controlled by it. We discuss examples where it acts as an oncogene or a tumour suppressor along with key targets affecting hallmarks of cancer. We discuss how cellular contexts regulate the biological effects of miR-17-92. The plausible mechanisms of its paradoxical roles are explained, and mechanisms are described that may contribute to cell fate regulation by miR-17-92. Further, we discuss recently developed strategies to target miR-17-92 cluster in human cancers.

Consequently, their control and quantification in food materials is crucial.

Nanoliposomes (NLs) are vesicular carriers formed by self-assembling phospholipids that surround the aqueous cores. Utilizing their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high carrying capacity, researchers have employed NLs in biosensors for monitoring various targets in biological and food samples. The NLs are used for surface modification, signal marker delivery, and detection of toxins, bacteria, pesticides, and diseases. Here, we review marker-entrapped NLs used in the development of NL-based biosensors for mycotoxins. These biosensors are sensitive, selective, portable, and cost-effective analytical tools, and the resulting signal can be produced and/or amplified with or without destroying the NLs.

We employed biological neural computations of the antennal lobe circuitry for generating spatiotemporal neuronal response templates corresponding to each cell culture VOC mixture, and employed these neuronal templates to distinguish oral cancer cell lines (SAS, Ca9-22, and HSC-3) vs. a non-cancer cell line (HaCaT). Our results demonstrate that three different human oral cancers can be robustly distinguished from each other and from a non-cancer oral cell line.

However, variants with the largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes are expected to be rare in the population. Hence, studying rare variants may provide additional insights into disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, thereby informing therapeutics development.

In an analysis of 5,085 severe disease cases and 571,737 controls, we observed that carrying a rare deleterious variant in the SARS-CoV-2 sensor toll-like receptor TLR7 (on chromosome X) was associated with a 5.3-fold increase in severe disease (95% CI: 2.75-10.05, p = 5.41x10-7).

In this strategy, a nanoprobe based on a DNA walker was designed for the simultaneous signal amplification of nucleolin (NCL) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in a single cell.

The cancerous cells and their corresponding normal cells are both considered to be liquid cells each with their unique refractive index (RI). Normally these cells are found in liquid form in the suitable media (food) required to live the cancerous/normal cell lines. Also in our detection case, liquid samples are easy to pump into the sensing channel of the proposed PCF by employing either pressure or capillary forces.The proposed PCF sensor works on the SPR principle, with the Au coating serving as the plasmonic material. This sensor is investigated using the COMSOL Multiphysics software computational tool that is based on the full-vector finite element method (FEM). A TiO2 coating has been applied to enhance adhesion between the Au layer and the PCF surface. Above the Au coating, cancerous cells samples are filled into the PCF. When the core mode of the PCF is coupled with the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode under the specific resonance circumstances, SPR will occur on the interface of the gold-sample cell, and in the core mode, the loss peak is observed at the resonance wavelength. Cancerous cells samples have a distinct loss peak than normal cells samples therefore the cancerous cells can be diagnosed by measuring the shift in resonance wavelength corresponding to the loss peak of cancerous and their normal cells samples. The proposed sensor may identify various cancerous cells such as MDAMB-231, MCF-7, PC12, HeLa, and Jurkat for the diagnosis of breast cancer type-1, breast cancer type-2, adrenal glands, cervical, and blood cancer respectively. The computed wavelengths sensitivities of the proposed PCF are 9428.57 nm/RIU, 10714.28 nm/RIU, 7571.43 nm/RIU, 5500 nm/RIU, and 6000 nm/RIU for the MDAMB-231, MCF-7, PC12, HeLa, and Jurkat cancerous cells, respectively. However, for various cancerous cells, the maximum amplitude sensitivity varies from -1387 RIU-1 to -1599 RIU-1. Moreover, the sensor resolution ranges between 0.93&#215;10-5 RIU and 1.82&#215;10-5 RIU with a 0.024 maximum detection limit.

However, the complete set of multi-phase CT is often not available in practical clinical applications. In recent years, there have been some studies to generate the missing modality image from the available data. Nevertheless, the generated images are not guaran- teed to be effective for the diagnosis task. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for kidney cancer diagnosis with incomplete multi-phase CT, which simultaneously re- covers missing CT images and classifies cancer subtypes using the completed set of images. The advantage of our framework is that it encourages a synthesis model to ex- plicitly learn to generate missing CT phases that are helpful for classifying cancer subtypes. We further incorporate lesion segmentation network into our framework to exploit lesion-level features for effective cancer classification in the whole CT volumes. The proposed framework is based on fully 3D convolutional neural networks to jointly optimize both synthesis and classification of 3D CT volumes. Exten- sive experiments on both in-house and external datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for the diagnosis with incomplete data compared with state-of-the- art baselines.

We used conditional Cre-LoxP mice to investigate how specific loss of BMPR1A in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts/smooth muscle cells affects intestinal homeostasis. Selective loss of BMPR1A in fibroblasts causes severe histological changes in the intestines with a significant increase in stromal cell content and epithelial cell hyperproliferation, leading to numerous serrated polyps.

Finally, in CRC patient specimens, mRNA-expression data showed that patients with high GREMLIN1 and CXCL12 expression had a significantly poorer overall survival. Significantly higher GREMLIN1, NOGGIN, and CXCL12 expression were detected in the Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) colorectal cancers, which are thought to arise from serrated polyps.

We report here that exit from stemness and differentiation of pluripotent cells along the neural lineage are controlled by CDC14, a CDK-counteracting phosphatase whose function in mammals remains obscure. Lack of the two CDC14 family members, CDC14A and CDC14B, results in deficient development of the neural system in the mouse and impairs neural differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically, CDC14 directly dephosphorylates specific proline-directed Ser/Thr residues of undifferentiated embryonic transcription Factor 1 (UTF1) during the exit from stemness, triggering its proteasome-dependent degradation. Multiomic single-cell analysis of transcription and chromatin accessibility in differentiating ESCs suggests that increased UTF1 levels in the absence of CDC14 prevent the proper firing of bivalent promoters required for differentiation.

Contrived bTMB reference materials were developed using genomic DNA from lung tumor cell lines blended into donor-matched lymphoblastoid cell lines at 0.5% and 2% tumor content, fragmented and size-selected to mirror the size profile of circulating cell-free tumor DNA with TMB scores of 7, 9, 20, and 26 mut/Mb.

We observed that in kidneys from mice with juvenile cystic kidney (jck) ciliopathy, the aberrant hyperactivity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) driven by ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT cascades induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteotoxic stress. To reduce it by reprogramming translation, the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#945; (eIF2&#945;) arm of the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; drove the selective translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), potentiating YAP expression.

Dependent on the superior photothermal ability of B1, NP1 elicits high photothermal conversion efficiency (&#951; = 19.9%) under NIR light irradiation for PTT. Moreover, NP1 serves as in situ H2S bombers in the hypoxic tumor environment and suppresses the mitochondrial respiration through inhibiting expression of cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) and cutting off the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation.

Membrane stress from polymyxins results in activation of two-component regulatory systems that produce lipid A modifying enzymes. These enzymes add neutral moieties, such as aminoarabinose (AraN) and ethanolamine (EtN) to lipid A terminal phosphates that mask the phosphate's negative charge and inhibit electrostatic interaction with the cationic polymyxins.

Herein we describe a GC-MS method to quantitate lipid A backbone components, glucosamine (GlcN) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), along with terminal phosphate modifications AraN and EtN. In this assay, lipid A is isolated from Gram-negative bacterial samples, hydrolyzed into its individual moieties, and derivatized via methoximation followed by silylation prior to analysis via GC-MS. Changes in AraN and EtN quantity were characterized using a variety of regulatory mutants of Salmonella, revealing differences that were not detected using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Additionally, an increase in the abundance of AraN and EtN modifications were observed when resistant Enterobacter and Escherichia coli strains were grown in the presence of colistin (polymyxin E).

While the previous meta-analysis suggests that estrogen receptor (ESR) genetic polymorphisms are closely associated with dementia, the implications of this observation on a molecular level are not entirely understood. Our study explores this intricate molecular puzzle through the use of a variety of bioinformatics tools. Initially, we attempted to elucidate mechanisms underlying breast cancer development by identifying the high-throughput dataset of ESR1-knockdown breast cancer tissue samples. Surprisingly, KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the most frequently occurring proteins were related to axonal guidance and inflammation-related gene markers. These observations were supported by an external high throughput dataset of AD inflammatory samples in vivo.

Specifically, is the relation linear, with higher SES associated with better outcomes, or does the direction of association change at different levels of SES? Our aim was to examine linear (\"more is better\") and quadratic (\"better near the middle\") associations between components of SES (i.e., income, years of education, occupational status/prestige) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale), and to explore moderation by developmental period (adolescence, young, middle, and older adulthood), gender/sex (female, male), and race/ethnicity (Asian American, Black, Latinx, multiracial, Native American, White). We hypothesized that there would be more support for a model containing quadratic associations. We conducted a two-stage meta-analytic structural equation model of 60 data sets (27,242 correlations, 498,179 participants) within the United States, accounting for dependencies between correlations, which were identified via the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research and handled using a two-step approach. Income was quadratically associated with depressive symptoms, but the quadratic model did not explain more variance in depressive symptoms than the linear model. Developmental period and race/ethnicity moderated the associations: Income was quadratically associated with depressive symptoms among middle-aged adults, and years of education were quadratically associated with depressive symptoms among White samples. Our findings suggest that researchers and clinical practitioners should consider the elevated risk of depressive symptoms for individuals from low and high-income backgrounds in the United States.

No field strength or sequence restrictions. The data including the study population, study characteristics, as well as basic MRI characteristics, from the final studies included in this review, were extracted independently by two reviewers. The major results of the original study were summarized and no additional statistical analysis was performed. Among the 23 studies included in this review, 17 focused on the applications of MRS and MRI for the prebiopsy diagnosis of PCa. Nine of these 17 articles used Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score to interpret MRI results, thereby confirming the practicality of the PI-RADS score in predicting PCa and csPCa. The remaining six articles evaluated the applications of MRI and MRS in guiding prostate biopsy. Although there was a variation in the biopsy modalities used in these studies, both MRI- and MRS-guided prostate biopsies were observed to improve the detection rates of PCa and csPCa in patients with PSA levels within the gray zone.

In vitro results showed that the HS15-Myr nanomicelles enhanced the antioxidant activity of myricetin (Myr) and inhibited cisplatin-induced proliferation inhibition of HK-2 cells. Moreover, the HS15-Myr nanomicelles inhibited cisplatin-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, and DNA damage, which might be related to the inhibition of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)&#9472;stimulating interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway. In vivo results in mice showed that the significant reductions in body weight and renal indices and the increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels induced by cisplatin could be significantly reversed by pretreating with the HS15-Myr nanomicelles. Furthermore, nanomicelle pretreatment significantly altered the activities of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., GSH, MDA, and SOD) induced by cisplatin.

Through this motif, HPV E6 targets a large number of cellular substrates, many of which are involved in processes related to the regulation of cell polarity. Recent studies also demonstrated E6's PDZ binding motif (PBM)-dependent association with SNX27, with a potential role in the perturbation of endocytic transport. Here, we have performed a proteomic analysis to identify SNX27-interacting partners whose binding to SNX27 is specifically perturbed in an E6-dependent manner. Extracts of HeLa cells that express GFP-tagged SNX27, transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting E6AP, were subject to GFP immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectroscopy, which identified TANC2 as an interacting partner of SNX27. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HPV E6 inhibits association between SNX27 and TANC2 in a PBM-dependent manner, resulting in an increase in TANC2 protein levels. In the absence of E6, SNX27 directs TANC2 toward lysosomal degradation. TANC2, in the presence of HPV-18E6, enhances cell proliferation in a PBM-dependent manner, indicating that HPV E6 targets the SNX27-mediated transport of TANC2 to promote cellular proliferation. IMPORTANCE While a great deal is known about the role of the E6 PDZ binding motif (PBM) in modulating the cellular proteins involved in regulating cell polarity, much less is known about the consequences of E6's interactions with SNX27 and the endocytic sorting machinery. We reasoned that a potential consequence of such interactions could be to affect the fate of multiple SNX27 endosomal partners, such as transmembrane proteins or soluble accessory proteins. Using a proteomic approach in HPV-18-positive cervical tumor-derived cells, we demonstrate that TANC2 is an interacting partner of SNX27, whose interaction is blocked by E6 in a PBM-dependent manner. This study therefore begins to shed new light on how E6 can regulate the endocytic transport of multiple SNX27-binding proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of the functions of the E6 PBM.\", 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36326270': {'ArticleTitle': 'Enhanced Fusobacterium nucleatum Genetics Using Host DNA Methyltransferases To Bypass Restriction-Modification Systems.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Bacterial restriction-modification (R-M) systems are a first-line immune defense against foreign DNA from viruses and other bacteria. While R-M systems are critical in maintaining genome integrity, R-M nucleases unfortunately present significant barriers to targeted genetic modification. Bacteria of the genus Fusobacterium are oral, Gram-negative, anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens that are implicated in the progression and severity of multiple cancers and tissue infections, yet our understanding of their direct roles in disease have been severely hindered by their genetic recalcitrance. Here, we demonstrate a path to overcome these barriers in Fusobacterium by using native DNA methylation as a host mimicry strategy to bypass R-M system cleavage of transformed plasmid DNA. We report the identification, characterization, and successful use of Fusobacterium nucleatum type II and III DNA methyltransferase (MTase) enzymes to produce a multifold increase in gene knockout efficiency in the strain Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum 23726, as well as the first system for efficient gene knockouts and complementations in F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum 25586. We show plasmid protection can be accomplished in vitro with purified enzymes, as well as in vivo in an Escherichia coli host that constitutively expresses F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum MTase enzymes. In summary, this proof-of-concept study characterizes specific MTases that are critical for bypassing R-M systems and has enhanced our understanding of enzyme combinations that could be used to genetically modify clinical isolates of Fusobacterium that have thus far been inaccessible to molecular characterization. IMPORTANCE Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral opportunistic pathogen associated with diseases that include cancer and preterm birth. Our understanding of how this bacterium modulates human disease has been hindered by a lack of genetic systems. Here, we show that F. nucleatum DNA methyltransferase-modified plasmid DNA overcomes the transformation barrier and has allowed the development of a genetic system in a previously inaccessible strain. We present a strategy that could potentially be expanded to enable the genetic modification of highly recalcitrant strains, thereby fostering investigational studies to uncover novel host-pathogen interactions in Fusobacterium.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36326265': {'ArticleTitle': 'Ovarian Cancer Metastasis to the Central Nervous System: A Literature Review.', 'ArticleAbstract': \"Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States.

To address these issues and develop potent yet low-inflammatory mRNA cancer vaccine vectors, we synthesized a series of alternating copolymers \"PHTA\" featured with ortho-hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeating units for mRNA delivery, which can play triple roles of condensing mRNA, enhancing the polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) stability, and prolonging circulation time. Unlike the LNPs exhibiting high levels of inflammation, the PHTA-based PNPs showed negligible inflammatory side effects in vivo.

Peptides that have a combination of conformational rigidity and flexibility can be used to target difficult binding interfaces with appropriate binding affinity and specificity. Since the introduction of insulin nearly a century ago, more than 80 peptide drugs have been approved to treat a variety of diseases. These include deadly diseases such as cancer and human immunodeficiency virus infection. It is also useful against diabetes, chronic pain, and osteoporosis. Today, more research is being done on these drugs as lessons learned from earlier approaches, which are still valid today, complement newer approaches such as peptide display libraries. At the same time, integrated genomics and peptide display libraries are new strategies that open new avenues for peptide drug discovery. The purpose of this review is to examine the problems in elucidating the peptide-protein recognition mechanism. This is important to develop peptide-based interventions that interfere with endogenous protein interactions.

The internal chemical modification of the target RNA at a specific site is a basic feature of epitranscriptomics and is critical for its structural stability and functional property. More than 170 modifications at the transcriptomic level have been reported so far, among which m6A methylation is one of the more conserved internal RNA modifications, abundantly found in eukaryotic mRNAs and frequently involved in enhancing the target messenger RNA\\'s (mRNA) stability and translation. m6A modification of mRNAs is essential for multiple physiological processes including stem cell differentiation, nervous system development and gametogenesis. Any aberration in the m6A modification can often result in a pathological condition. The deregulation of m6A methylation has already been described in inflammation, viral infection, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The m6A modification is reversible in nature and is carried out by specialized m6A proteins including writers (m6A methyltransferases) that add methyl groups and erasers (m6A demethylases) that remove methyl groups selectively.

Although accumulation of AGEs occurs naturally in vivo over time, it is greatly accelerated by the hyperglycemic environment of diabetic patients. AGE accumulation has been linked to stiffening-related diseases such as hypertension, cancer metastasis, and neurodegenerative disorders. In response, several AGE-inhibiting and AGE-breaking drugs have received significant attention for their ability to reduce AGE accumulation. The resulting effects of these drugs on cell behavior is not well understood. In this study, we measured cancer cell migration in glycated collagen with and without the AGE-breaking drug alagebrium chloride (ALT711) to investigate the drug's ability to disrupt ECM crosslinks and reduce tumor cell spreading, contractility, and migration. The mechanical properties and chemical composition of collagen glycated with increasing concentrations of glucose with and without ALT711 treatment were measured. Increasing glucose concentration resulted in increased AGE accumulation and matrix stiffness as well as increased cancer cell contractility, elongation, and migration. Treatment with ALT711 significantly lowered AGE accumulation within the collagen, decreased collagen stiffness, and reduced cell migration. These findings suggest that while hyperglycemia can increase collagen matrix stiffness, resulting in increased breast cancer cell migration, an AGE-breaker can reverse this phenotype and may be a viable treatment option for reducing cancer cell migration due to glycation.\", 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325926': {'ArticleTitle': 'NIR-II-triggered doxorubicin release for orthotopic bladder cancer chemo-photothermal therapy.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Intravesical instillation has been widely utilized for bladder cancer treatment in clinic.

Few genetic markers are associated with the outcome of T-ALL patients, independently of measurable residual disease (MRD) status after therapy. In addition, the prognostic relevance of genetic features may be modulated by the specific treatment used. We analyzed the genetic profile of 145 T-ALL patients by targeted deep sequencing. Genomic information was integrated with the clinical-biological and survival data of a subset of 116 adult patients enrolled in two consecutive MRD-oriented trials of the Spanish PETHEMA (Programa Espa&#241;ol de Tratamientos en Hematolog&#237;a) group. Genetic analysis revealed a mutational profile defined by DNMT3A/ N/KRAS/ MSH2/ U2AF1 gene mutations that identified refractory/resistant patients. Mutations in the DMNT3A gene were also found in the nonleukemic cell fraction of patients with T-ALL, revealing a possible mutational-driven clonal hematopoiesis event to prime T-ALL in elderly.

In its intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway opposing members of the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family meet at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) to control its integrity. Any imbalance can cause disorders, with upregulation of the cell-guarding anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein itself being common in many, often incurable cancers. Normally, the Bcl-2 protein itself is embedded in the MOM where it sequesters cell-killing apoptotic proteins such as Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) which would otherwise perforate the MOM and subsequently cause cell death. However, the molecular basis of Bcl-2's ability to recognize those apoptotic proteins via their common BH3 death motifs remains elusive due to the lack of structural insight. By employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on fully functional human Bcl-2 protein in membrane-mimicking micelles, we identified glycine residues across all functional domains of the Bcl-2 protein, and could monitor their residue specific individual response upon the presence of a Bax-derived 36 aa long BH3 domain. The observed chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) allowed us to determine the response and individual affinity of each glycine residue and provide an overall picture of the individual roles by which Bcl-2's functional domains engage in recognizing and inhibiting apoptotic proteins via their prominent BH3 motifs.

Ten-week-old female mice were inoculated with 4&#160;T1 cells (week 0) and were either subjected to a 2&#160;cm long cutaneous contralateral incision (wounded) or control (non-wounded) on week 2 and monitored for 3&#8201;weeks (week 5). Mice with surgical wounding displayed significantly accelerated tumor growth observable as early as 1-week post wounding. This was confirmed by increased tumor volume and tumor weight, post-mortem. Further, surgical wounding increased metastasis to the lungs, as detected by IVIS imaging, in vivo and ex vivo (week 5). As expected then, wounded mice displayed decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in both the primary tumor and in the lungs. Flow cytometry revealed that primary tumors from wounded mice exhibited increased tumor associated macrophages and specifically M2-like macrophages, which are important in promoting tumor development, maintenance, and metastasis. Immunofluorescence staining and gene expression data further confirms an increase in macrophages in both the primary tumor and the lungs of wounded mice. Our data suggests that surgical wounding accelerates tumor progression and lung metastasis in a mouse model of TNBC, which is likely mediated, at least in part by an increase in macrophages.\", 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325600': {'ArticleTitle': 'Significance of nuclear EGFR and ABCG2 expression in malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) and the stem cell marker ABCG2 in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral erythroplakia (OE) and to assess their significance as prognostic biomarkers for malignant transformation.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325598': {'ArticleTitle': 'The T-shaped FST pharyngoplasty step-by-step closure technique.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Pharyngocutaneous fistula is one of the most common and serious complications associated with total laryngectomy.

We will discuss the role of MSR1 in health and disease with a focus on the molecular mechanisms influencing MSR1 expression, how altered expression affects disease process and macrophage function, the limited cell signalling pathways discovered thus far, the emerging role of MSR1 in tumour associated macrophages as well as the therapeutic potential of targeting MSR1.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325337': {'ArticleTitle': 'Salvage high intensity focused ultrasound for residual or recurrent cervical cancer after definitive chemoradiotherapy.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'The treatment of residual/recurrent cervical cancer within a previously irradiated area is challenging and generally associated with a poor outcome.

Tumour molecular subtypes and prognostic biomarkers play a crucial role in LGG diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers in LGG patients is crucial for predicting the prognosis of glioma. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is defined as regulated cell death that is sufficient to activate the adaptive immune response of immunocompetent hosts. The combination of ICD and immunotherapy might exert a greater and more persistent antitumour effect in gliomas. In our study, we explored the expression, function, and genetic alterations of 34 ICD-related genes. Using 12 ICD-related genes, including IL17RA, IL1R1, EIF2AK3, CD4, PRF1, CXCR3, CD8A, BAX, PDIA3, CASP8, MYD88, and CASP1, we constructed and validated an ICD-related risk signature via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. All the information was obtained from public databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Our results revealed that ICD-high risk groups have a poor prognosis and might be more sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In addition, ICD-high risk groups were associated with 1p19q noncodeletion, higher WHO grade, wild type IDH, and an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. We verified the prognostic value of 12 ICD-related genes in TCGA and CGGA databases. Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the expression of several ICD-related genes at the protein level.

Consequently, macrophages exhibit significant plasticity and change their transcriptional profile and function in response to environmental, tissue, and inflammatory stimuli resulting in pro- and anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, the categorization of tissue macrophages in inflammatory situations remains difficult; however, there is an agreement that macrophages are predominantly polarized into two different subtypes with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, the so-called M1-like and M2-like macrophages, respectively. These two macrophage classes can be considered as the extreme borders of a continuum of many intermediate subsets. On one end, M1 are pro-inflammatory macrophages that initiate an immunological response, damage tissue integrity, and dampen tumor progression by fostering robust T and natural killer (NK) cell anti-tumoral responses. On the other end, M2 are anti-inflammatory macrophages involved in tissue remodeling and tumor growth, that promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis and that participate to immune suppression. These decisive roles in tumor progression occur through the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases, as well as by the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in the case of M2 macrophages. Moreover, macrophage plasticity is supported by stimuli from the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) that are relayed to the nucleus through membrane receptors and signaling pathways that result in gene expression reprogramming in macrophages, thus giving rise to different macrophage polarization outcomes. In this review, we will focus on the main signaling pathways involved in macrophage polarization that are activated upon ligand-receptor recognition and in the presence of other immunomodulatory molecules in cancer.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325327': {'ArticleTitle': 'Corrigendum: A comprehensively prognostic and immunological analysis of actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5 in pan-cancer and identification in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'ArticleAbstract': '[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.944898.].', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325324': {'ArticleTitle': '&#946;-Carboline dimers inhibit the tumor proliferation by the cell cycle arrest of sarcoma through intercalating to Cyclin-A2.', 'ArticleAbstract': '&#946;-Carbolines are potentially strong alkaloids with a wide range of bioactivities, and their dimers exhibit stronger antitumor activity other than the monomers. However, the detailed mechanisms of the &#946;-carboline dimers in inhibiting sarcoma (SARC) remain unclear. The results showed that &#946;-carboline-3-carboxylic acid dimers Comp1 and Comp2, which were synthesized in our lab and modified at the N9 position and linked at the C3 position, exhibited effective inhibition activity on MG-63 proliferation (IC50 = 4.6&#956;M). Meanwhile, the large scale transcriptome profiles of SARC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed, and found that abnormal expression of genes relevant to apoptosis, cell cycle, and signaling pathways of Hedgehog, HIF, Ras involved in the SARC pathogenesis. Interestingly, both dimers could promote the apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle in S phase to inhibit proliferation of MG-63. Moreover, Comp1 and Comp2 inhibited the expression CDK2, CCNA2, DBF4, and PLK1 associated with various immune cells and cell cycle in MG-63. Remarkably, drug-target interaction network analysis showed that numerous proteins involved in cell cycle were the potential targets of Comp1 and Comp2, especially CCNA2. Further molecular docking, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) confirmed that both dimers could directly interact with CCNA2, which is significantly correlated with CD4+ T cells, by strong hydrophobic interactions (Kd=5.821 &#215;106 N). Meanwhile, the levels of CCNA2 and CDK2 were inhibited to decrease in MG-63 by both dimer treatments at transcription and protein levels, implying that Comp1 and Comp2 blocked the interaction between CCNA2 and CDK2 through competitive binding with CCNA2 to arrest the cell cycle of MG-63 cells in the S phase. Additionally, the transcriptome profiles of &#946;-carboline-treated mice from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were obtained, and found that similar antitumor mechanism was shared among &#946;-carboline derivatives. Overall, our results elucidated the antitumor mechanisms of Comp1 and Comp2 through dual-suppressing the function of CCNA2 to profoundly arrest cell cycle of MG-63, then effectively inhibited cell proliferation of MG-63.

Herein, the influence of Tween-80, Tween-60, cholesterol, and DOTAP on the entrapment efficiency (EE%) of curcumin and the physicochemical properties of the carrier are fully discussed. The optimum engineered formulation resulted in a positive charge of +11.23&#160;mV, high EE (100%), smooth surface, spherical shape, small diameter (90&#160;nm), and good stability in physiological buffers. Also, an accelerated cellular uptake, as well as drug release in PBS (pH 7.4, 37&#176;C) after 72&#160;h, were observed.

The results displayed an improved cytotoxic activity of Cur-niosome towards cancer cells compared to free-dispersed Cur. The uptake of Cur-loaded niosome by A280s and A280cp-1 cancer cell lines faced 2.5 folds drop in the concentration compared to its free form. Generally, Cur-niosome exhibits a significant accumulation of superior anti-cancer properties. Likewise, the cytotoxicity of miR-34a-niosome against tumor cells was higher in comparison with its free form. The anti-cancer effects of the gene/drug delivery were investigated in the 4T1 xenografted Balb/C mouse tumor model. According to the in vitro and in vivo results, gene delivery from the modified niosome nanoparticles was distinctly greater than Cur delivery.

Large anterolateral thigh flaps for chest wall cover, with multiple perforators from separate pedicles, also need supercharging. This needs an additional source of donor vessels, antegrade IMA/V being the first one. Materials and Methods &#8195;Retrospective study of microvascular breast reconstruction using retrograde internal mammary donor vessels. Results &#8195;Out of 35 cases, 20 cases had distal IMA/V, with retrograde flow, as donor vessel for second set of arterial and venous anastomosis. In two cases, retrograde IMA/V was used for the solitary set of MVA. In remaining 13 cases, either retrograde IMA or V was utilized either as a principal or accessory donor. No flap was lost. Venous and arterial insufficiency happened in one case each, both were salvaged. Two cases developed partial necrosis, needing debridement and suturing. One case developed marginal necrosis. Only one case developed fat necrosis with superadded infection on follow-up. Conclusion &#8195;Distal end of IMA and IMV on retrograde flow is safe for MVA as an additional or sole pedicle. It is convenient to use being in the same field. It enables preservation of other including thoracodorsal pedicle and latissimus dorsi flap for use in case of a complication or recurrence.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325067': {'ArticleTitle': 'De novo serine biosynthesis from glucose predicts sex-specific response to antifolates in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Intriguingly, males with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a higher mortality rate than females. Here, we investigated the role of serine metabolism as a predictive marker for sensitivity to the antifolate pemetrexed in male and female NSCLC cell lines. Using [13C6] glucose tracing in NSCLC cell lines, we found that a subset of male cells generated significantly more serine from glucose than female cells. Higher serine biosynthesis was further correlated with increased sensitivity to pemetrexed in male cells only. Concordant sex differences in metabolic gene expression were evident in NSCLC and pan-cancer transcriptome datasets, suggesting a potential mechanism with wide-reaching applicability. These data were further validated by integrating antifolate drug cytotoxicity and metabolic pathway transcriptome data from pan-cancer cell lines.

We previously discovered that single KRasV12-transformed cells can invade directly from the epithelium by basal cell extrusion. During this process, cells de-differentiate by mechanically pinching off their epithelial determinants, but how they trans-differentiate into a migratory, mesenchymal phenotype is not known. Here, we demonstrate that basally extruded KRasV12-expressing cells become significantly deformed as they invade the zebrafish body. Decreasing the confinement that cells experience after they invade reduces the percentage of KRasV12 cells that trans-differentiate into mesenchymal cell types, while higher confinement increases this percentage. Additionally, increased confinement promotes accumulation of internal masses over time. Altogether, our results suggest that mechanical forces drive not only de-differentiation of KRasV12-transformed epithelial cells as they invade but also their re-differentiation into mesenchymal phenotypes that contribute to distant metastases.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36325065': {'ArticleTitle': 'Integrative epigenomic analyses of small cell lung cancer cells demonstrates the clinical translational relevance of gene body methylation.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'DNA methylation is a key regulator of gene expression and a clinical therapeutic predictor.

Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to detect the protein levels and mRNA levels of macrophage M2 polarization markers and their downstream signaling pathways. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 gene knockout (KO) mice and their controls were used to establish a PANC-02 orthotopic pancreatic cancer model, and immune cell infiltration in the tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: We found that sphingomyelin synthase 2 mRNA expression is positively correlated with tumor-associated macrophages, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 deficiency was confirmed to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of orthotopic PANC-02 tumors in vivo.

In tissue culture, YE2 inhibited M2 polarization in both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and THP-1 macrophages and eliminated the protumor effect of M2 macrophages. In the mouse model, YE2 treatment reduced the infiltration of TAMs and regulated other immune components in the tumor microenvironment, slowing the progression of PANC-02 tumors. In terms of mechanism, we found that the inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase 2 could downregulate the expression of IL4R&#945; and CSF1R, thereby attenuating M2 polarization. Conclusion: The sphingomyelin synthase 2 inhibitor YE2 or sphingomyelin synthase 2 deficiency can prevent macrophage M2 polarization in pancreatic cancer, and sphingomyelin synthase 2 could be a new potential target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36324676': {'ArticleTitle': 'Pharmacological OGG1 inhibition decreases murine allergic airway inflammation.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Background and aim: Allergic asthma is a complex inflammatory disease involving type 2 innate lymphoid cells, type 2&#160;T helper cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. The disease is characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, chest tightness and variable airflow limitation for which there is no cure and is symptomatically treated with inhaled corticosteroids and &#946;2-agonists. Molecular mechanisms underlying its complex pathogenesis are not fully understood. However, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), a DNA repair protein may play a central role, as OGG1 deficiency decreases both innate and allergic inflammation. Methods: Using a murine ovalbumin (OVA) model of allergic airway inflammation we assessed the utility of an inhibitor of OGG1 (TH5487) in this disease context. Cytokines and chemokines, promoting immune cell recruitment were measured using a 23-multiplex assay and Western blotting. Additionally, immune cell recruitment to bronchi was measured using flow cytometry. Histological analyses and immunofluorescent staining were used to confirm immune cell influx and goblet cell hyperplasia of the airways. A PCR array was used to assess asthma-related genes in murine lung tissue following TH5487 treatment. Finally, airway hyperresponsiveness was determined using in vivo lung function measurement. Results: In this study, administration of TH5487 to mice with OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation significantly decreased goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production. TH5487 treatment also decreased levels of activated NF-&#954;B and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting in significantly lower recruitment of eosinophils and other immune cells to the lungs. Gene expression profiling of asthma and allergy-related proteins after TH5487 treatment revealed differences in several important regulators, including down regulation of Tnfrsf4, Arg1, Ccl12 and Ccl11, and upregulation of the negative regulator of type 2 inflammation, Bcl6. Furthermore, the gene Clca1 was upregulated following TH5487 treatment, which should be explored further due to its ambiguous role in allergic asthma. In addition, the OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was significantly reduced by TH5487 treatment. Conclusion: Taken together, the data presented in this study suggest OGG1 as a clinically relevant pharmacological target for the treatment of allergic inflammation.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36324675': {'ArticleTitle': 'Stimuli-responsive platinum and ruthenium complexes for lung cancer therapy.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

The nature of sPLA2IIa inhibition was evaluated by increasing calcium concentration from 2.5 to 15&#160;&#181;M and substrate from 20 to 120&#160;nM, which did not alter the level of inhibition. Intrinsic fluorescence and far UV-CD studies confirmed the direct interaction of quercitrin with the sPLA2IIa enzyme.

The toxicity was assessed by acute toxicity and micronucleus tests in mice. The in vivo antitumor effect of ACS-AZ (12.5, 25, or 50&#160;mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) was determined using the Ehrlich tumor model, and toxicity. The antinociceptive efficacy of the compound (50&#160;mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated using formalin and hot plate assays in mice. The role of the opioid system was also investigated. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 (lethal dose 50%) value was 500&#160;mg/kg (i.p.), and no detectable genotoxic effect was observed. After a 7-day treatment, ACS-AZ significantly (p < 0.05) reduced tumor cell viability and peritumoral microvessels density, suggesting antiangiogenic action. In addition, ACS-AZ reduced (p < 0.05) IL-1&#946; and CCL-2 levels, which may be related to the antiangiogenic effect, while increasing (p < 0.05) TNF-&#945; and IL-4 levels, which are related to its direct cytotoxicity. ACS-AZ also decreased (p < 0.05) oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) levels, both of which are crucial mediators in cancer known for their angiogenic action. Moreover, weak toxicological effects were recorded after a 7-day treatment (biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters). Concerning antinociceptive activity, ACS-AZ was effective on hotplate and formalin (early and late phases) tests (p < 0.05), characteristic of analgesic agents with central action. Through pretreatment with the non-selective (naloxone) and &#956;1-selective (naloxonazine) opioid antagonists, we observed that the antinociceptive effect of ACS-AZ is mediated mainly by &#956;1-opioid receptors (p < 0.05).

The HER2 status of 108 patients with UCB who underwent radical cystectomy was assessed using immunohistochemistry, and its association with the recurrence and survival rates of patients was analyzed. HER2 overexpression was observed in 57.4% of the patients; this was significantly associated with higher tumor grades (P=0.006) and stages (P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that patients with HER2 overexpression had a shorter 5-year overall survival rate (P=0.005) and recurrence-free survival rate (P=0.003).

Although the PARPi Olaparib is limited to treating cancer patients with DNA repair deficiencies, the PARPi Niraparib is FDA approved to treat ovarian cancer patients regardless of their status in DNA repair pathways. Despite differences in the affinity to PARP enzymes, the rationale behind the clinical use of Niraparib in patients without DNA repair deficiencies is still lacking. Moreover, only Olaparib has been approved for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with BRCA mutations, accounting for only 5-7% of total PDACs. It remains unclear whether Niraparib could be beneficial to PDACs without BRCA mutations. We found that Niraparib inhibits ovarian and PDAC tumor cell growth, regardless of BRCA mutational status, more effectively than Olaparib. Unlike Olaparib, which is known to activate STAT3, Niraparib inhibits STAT3 activity in ovarian and PDAC cancer cell lines and patient tumors. Moreover, Niraparib regulates the expression of several STAT3 downstream genes involved in apoptosis.

Differential analysis observed significantly peaked expression of SIRT6 and SIRT7 at IM. Weighted correlation network analysis on bulk transcriptome recognized significant correlations between SIRT1/6 and IM. The single-cell atlas identified one subgroup of B cells expressing high level of TFF1 (TFF1 hi naive B cell) that theoretically played important roles in defending microbial infection, while SIRT6 displayed a positive correlation with TFF1 low naive B cells. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis at different lesions (SG-AG, AG-IM, and IM-GC) highlighted that gene sets contributing to IM, e.g., Brush Border, were largely enriched from co-expressing genes of Sirtuins (SIRTs) in AG-IM.

The RNA-seq data of pancreatic cancer patients from the TCGA were then downloaded, and the differential expression gene set was obtained using R for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The intersection of the above gene sets and FOXN3-related genes was defined as related differentially expressed gene sets (DEGs), and enrichment analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Finally, we analyzed the relationship between FOXN3 and immune infiltration in pancreatic cancer.

One of the most common reasons for therapy failure is the development of acquired resistance of cancer cells. DNA-damaging agents are frequently used in first-line chemotherapy regimens and DNA damage response, and DNA repair pathways are significantly involved in the mechanisms of chemoresistance. MRE11, a part of the MRN complex involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, is connected to colorectal cancer (CRC) patients' prognosis. Our previous results showed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) microRNA (miRNA) binding sites of MRE11 gene are associated with decreased cancer risk but with shorter survival of CRC patients, which implies the role of miRNA regulation in CRC. The therapy of colorectal cancer utilizes oxaliplatin (oxalato(trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum), which is often compromised by chemoresistance development. There is, therefore, a crucial clinical need to understand the cellular processes associated with drug resistance and improve treatment responses by applying efficient combination therapies. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miRNAs on the oxaliplatin therapy response of CRC patients. By the in silico analysis, miR-140 was predicted to target MRE11 and modulate CRC prognosis. The lower expression of miR-140 was associated with the metastatic phenotype (p < 0.05) and poor progression-free survival (odds ratio (OR) = 0.4, p < 0.05). In the in vitro analysis, we used miRNA mimics to increase the level of miR-140 in the CRC cell line. This resulted in decreased proliferation of CRC cells (p < 0.05). Increased levels of miR-140 also led to increased sensitivity of cancer cells to oxaliplatin (p < 0.05) and to the accumulation of DNA damage. Our results, both in vitro and in vivo, suggest that miR-140 may act as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in DSB DNA repair and, consequently, CRC therapy response.\", 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36324568': {'ArticleTitle': 'Editorial: Stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'ArticleAbstract': '', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36324567': {'ArticleTitle': 'Case report: Using DNA short tandem repeats to confirm nongestational origin of pulmonary choriocarcinoma.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN) are malignant neoplasms that occur in pregnant or recently pregnant women.

Our work aims at investigating the prognostic value of lipid metabolism-related lncRNAs in CC. Methods: LncRNA expression profiling was conducted in 291 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Patient samples were randomly assigned to the training or testing set in a 3:2 ratio. A novel lipid metabolism-related five-lncRNA signature with prognostic value for CC was built through the univariate Cox regression, least absolute contraction and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and was further evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier methods. Relevant analyses were also applied to identify the independent clinicopathological factors. GO and KEGG analyses were conducted to investigate the biological functions and molecular pathways. Immune infiltration analysis was included to probe the relationship between lncRNA signature and cancer cell microenvironment. Results: The novel lipid metabolism-related five-lncRNA signature was confirmed to be predictive of overall survival (OS) in CC patients.

Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to assess the m6A modification patterns and identify m6A-modified genes in patients with CRC recurrence. Methods: The m6A modification patterns were comprehensively evaluated by the NMF algorithm based on the levels of 27 m6A regulators, and tumor microenvironment (TME) cell-infiltrating characteristics of these modification patterns were systematically assessed by ssGSEA and CIBERSORT algorithms. The principal component analysis algorithm based on the m6A scoring scheme was used to explore the m6A modification patterns of individual tumors with immune responses. The weighted correlation network analysis and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were applied to identify m6A-modified gene signatures. The single-cell expression dataset of CRC samples was used to explore the tumor microenvironment affected by these signatures. Results: Three distinct m6A modification patterns with significant recurrence-free survival (RFS) were identified in 804 CRC patients. The TME characterization revealed that the m6A modification pattern with longer RFS exhibited robust immune responses. CRC patients were divided into high- and low-score subgroups according to the m6A score individually, which was obtained from the m6A-related signature genes. The patients with low m6A scores had both longer RFS and overall survival (OS) with altered immune cell infiltration. Notably, m6A-modified genes showed significant differences related to the prognosis of CRC patients in the meta-GEO cohort and TCGA cohort. Single-cell expression indicated that ALVRL1 was centrally distributed in endothelial tip cells and stromal cells. Conclusion: The m6A modification plays an indispensable role in the formation of TME diversity and complexity.

Consistent with this theory, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert promising chemopreventive activity for ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, toxicity is associated with long-term use of NSAIDs due to their cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity. Previous studies suggest the antineoplastic activity of NSAIDs is COX independent, and rather may be exerted through phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition. PDEs represent a unique chemopreventive target for ovarian cancer given that ovulation is regulated by cyclic nucleotide signaling. Here we evaluate PDE10A as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian tumors revealed PDE10A overexpression was associated with significantly worse overall survival for patients. PDE10A expression also positively correlated with the upregulation of oncogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways. Using small molecule inhibitors, Pf-2545920 and a novel NSAID-derived PDE10A inhibitor, MCI-030, we show that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased ovarian cancer cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate these pro-apoptotic properties occur through PKA and PKG signaling by using specific inhibitors to block their activity. PDE10A genetic knockout in ovarian cancer cells through CRISP/Cas9 editing lead to decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and in vivo tumor growth. We also demonstrate that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased Wnt-induced &#946;-catenin nuclear translocation, as well as decreased EGF-mediated activation of RAS/MAPK and AKT pathways in ovarian cancer cells.

In this study, we describe the technique and analyze outcomes of a staged laparoscopic and robotic three-stage restorative proctocolectomy and compare the clinical outcome with the classical laparoscopic procedure.

The results show that CDDO blocks TPA-induced transformation dose dependently. Several differential expressed genes (DEGs) involved in skin cell transformation, while counteracted by CDDO, were revealed by differential expression analysis including Lyl1, Lad1, and Dennd2d. In CpG methylomic profiles, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the promoter region altered by TPA while showing the opposite methylation status in the CDDO treatment group were identified. The correlation between DNA methylation and RNA expression has been established and DMRs showing inverse correlation were further studied as potential therapeutic targets. From the CpG methylome and transcriptome results, CDDO significantly restored gene expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) inhibited by TPA by decreasing their promoter CpG methylation. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) shows that CDDO neutralized the effect of TPA through modulating cell cycles, cell migration, and inflammatory and immune response regulatory pathways. Notably, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (TNFR2) signaling was significantly downregulated by CDDO potentially contributing to prevention of TPA-induced cell transformation.

PP2A is a highly conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of human cancers. However, the relationship between PP2A and the Warburg effect in gastric cancer has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the expression profile of two endogenous inhibitors of PP2A, SET and CIP2A, in gastric cancer, were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies were performed to investigate the roles of PP2A in gastric cancer cell proliferation and glycolysis. Cell biological, molecular, and biochemical approaches were employed to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that SET and CIP2A were overexpressed in gastric cancer and associated with a decreased PP2A activity. Pharmacological activation of PP2A with FTY-720 and DT-061 in two gastric cancer cell lines significantly reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation and glycolytic ability. Importantly, inhibition of PP2A activity by genetic silencing of PPP2R5A resulted in a growth advantage, which can be largely compromised by the addition of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, suggesting a glycolysis-dependent effect of PP2A in gastric cancer. Mechanistically, the well-known transcription factor and glycolysis regulator c-Myc was discovered as the functional mediator of PP2A in regulating cell glycolysis. Ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-mutant c-Myc resistant to PP2A (MycT58A) restored the inhibitory effect of FTY-720 and DT-061 on lactate production and glucose uptake. Furthermore, there was a close association between SET and CIP2A expression and c-Myc gene signatures in gastric cancer samples.

PD-L1- cells are sensitive to T cell surveillance, whereas PD-L1+ cells are resistant, even in the presence of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP).

Here we demonstrate that elevated viscosity counterintuitively increases the motility of various cell types on two-dimensional surfaces and in confinement, and increases cell dissemination from three-dimensional tumour spheroids. Increased mechanical loading imposed by elevated viscosity induces an actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-complex-dependent dense actin network, which enhances Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) polarization through its actin-binding partner ezrin. NHE1 promotes cell swelling and increased membrane tension, which, in turn, activates transient receptor potential cation vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and mediates calcium influx, leading to increased RHOA-dependent cell contractility. The coordinated action of actin remodelling/dynamics, NHE1-mediated swelling and RHOA-based contractility facilitates enhanced motility at elevated viscosities. Breast cancer cells pre-exposed to elevated viscosity acquire TRPV4-dependent mechanical memory through transcriptional control of the Hippo pathway, leading to increased migration in zebrafish, extravasation in chick embryos and lung colonization in mice.

Here we show that melanoma cells interact with nociceptor neurons, leading to increases in their neurite outgrowth, responsiveness to noxious ligands and neuropeptide release. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-one such nociceptor-produced neuropeptide-directly increases the exhaustion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which limits their capacity to eliminate melanoma. Genetic ablation of the TRPV1 lineage, local pharmacological silencing of nociceptors and antagonism of the CGRP receptor RAMP1 all reduced the exhaustion of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes and decreased the growth of tumours, nearly tripling the survival rate of mice that were inoculated with B16F10 melanoma cells. Conversely, CD8+ T cell exhaustion was rescued in sensory-neuron-depleted mice that were treated with local recombinant CGRP. As compared with wild-type CD8+ T cells, Ramp1-/- CD8+ T cells were protected against exhaustion when co-transplanted into tumour-bearing Rag1-deficient mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of biopsies from patients with melanoma revealed that intratumoral RAMP1-expressing CD8+ T cells were more exhausted than their RAMP1-negative counterparts, whereas overexpression of RAMP1 correlated with a poorer clinical prognosis.

Effective immune reactivity against tumour antigens requires the infiltration and activation of tumour-infiltrating T-cells (TILs). In this context, ligation of the antigen-receptor complex (TCR) in combination with the co-receptor CD28 activates the intracellular mediator AKT (or PKB, protein kinase B) and its downstream targets. PD-1 inhibits the activation of AKT/PKB. Given this, we assessed whether the direct activation of AKT might be effective in activating the immune system to limit the growth of tumors that are resistant to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. We found that the small molecule activator of AKT (SC79) limited growth of a B16 tumor and an EMT-6 syngeneic breast tumor model that are poorly responsive to PD-1 immunotherapy. In the case of B16 tumors, direct AKT activation induced (i) a reduction of suppressor regulatory (Treg) TILs and (ii) an increase in effector CD8+ TILs.

Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD3+C5AR1+, CD3+CLEC4A+ and CD3+NLRP3+ expression in early-stage NSCLC patients compared to healthy volunteers was 185 [64.2-4801] vs. 107.5 [27-229, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001], 91.2 [42.4-2355] vs. 71.25 [46.2-103, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0005], and 1585 [478-5224] vs. 758.5 [318-1976, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001], respectively. NLRP3:CD3 ratio, CD3+C5AR1+, CD3+CLEC4A+ and CD3+NLRP3+ MFI were significantly higher in early-stage NSCLC than healthy volunteers with an area under the ROC curve of 0.69-0.76. The CD3+NLRP3+ MFI provided the most distinguishable expression at 71.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity. Furthermore, CD3+NLRP3+ MFI potentially discriminated between early-stage NSCLC from malignant-mimic inflammation and infection pulmonary disease.

For RiA, PCa cells labeled by antibody-conjugated Raman probe were detected by Raman spectrometer. TGiA and RiA were first optimized by the detection of PCa cultured cells (DU145) spiked into control urine, with TGiA-OSAM showing single-cell PCa detection sensitivity, while RiA had a limit of detection of 4-10 cells/mL.

We find that squamous differentiation is a marker of intratumoral genomic and immunologic heterogeneity in patients with bladder cancer and a biomarker of intrinsic immunotherapy resistance. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that in all cases the urothelial and squamous regions are derived from a common shared precursor. Despite the presence of marked genomic heterogeneity between co-existent urothelial and squamous differentiated regions, no recurrent genomic alteration exclusive to the urothelial or squamous morphologies is identified.

To overcome these limitations, we investigated the structure-dependent activity of heptamethine cyanine dyes (HMCD), a group of tumour-specific and BBB permeable near-infrared fluorescent dyes, in both commercial (U87MG) and patient-derived GBM cell lines. HMCD analogues with strongly ionisable sulphonic acid groups were not taken up by patient derived GBM cells, but were taken up by the U87MG cell line. HMCD uptake relies on a combination of transporter uptake through organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and endocytosis into GBM cells. The uptake of HMCDs was not affected by p-glycoprotein efflux in GBM cells. Finally, we demonstrate structure-dependent cytotoxic activity at high concentrations (EC50 ; 1-100 &#956;M), likely due to mitochondrial damage-induced apoptosis. An in vivo orthotopic glioblastoma model highlights tumour-specific accumulation of our lead HMCD, MHI-148, for up to 7&#8201;days following a single intraperitoneal injection. These studies suggest that strongly ionisable groups like sulphonic acids hamper the cellular uptake of HMCDs in patient-derived GBM cell lines, highlighting cell-line specific differences in HMCD uptake. We envisage these findings will help in the design and structural modifications of HMCDs for drug delivery applications for glioblastoma.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36323650': {'ArticleTitle': 'Compounds from Diverse Natural Origin against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is caused due to the lack of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression. TNBC is the most aggressive heterogeneous disease that is capable of producing different clones and mutations. Tumorigenesis in TNBC is caused due to the mutation or overexpression of tumor suppressor genes. It is also associated with mutations in the BRCA gene which is linked to hereditary breast cancer. In addition, PARP proteins and checkpoint proteins also play a crucial function in causing TNBC. Many cell signaling pathways are dysregulated in TNBC. Even though chemotherapy and immunotherapy are good options for TNBC treatment, the response rates are still low in general. Many phytochemicals that are derived from natural compounds have shown very good inhibitions for TNBC. Natural compounds have the great advantage of being less toxic, having lesser side effects, and being easily available. The secondary metabolites like alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, and flavonoids in natural products make them promising inhibitors of TNBC. Their compositions also offer vital insights regarding inhibitory action, which could lead to new cancer-fighting strategies.

The evidence supports use of dose-adjusted EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin) with or without rituximab as first-line therapy. The need for central venous access, growth factors and significant toxicities limits its use in resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel regimen, CVEP (cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, etoposide, and prednisolone) based on the pharmacodynamic principles of dose-adjusted EPOCH. This single-centre phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of CVEP regimen in patients with de novo systemic AIDS-related DLBCL and PBL.

Especially appealing in this context is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is a photon-initiated treatment modality that uses cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill malignant cells. In the past decade, PDT has risen to the forefront of cancer therapy. Its optical control enables noninvasive and spatiotemporal manipulation of the treatment process, and its photoactive nature allows unique patterns to avoid drug resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics. However, despite the impressive advances in this field, achieving widespread clinical adoption of PDT remains difficult. A major concern is that in the hostile tumor microenvironment, tumor cells are hypoxic, which hinders ROS generation during PDT action. To overcome this \"Achilles\\' heel\", current strategies focus primarily on the improvement of the intratumoral O2 perfusion, while clinical trials suggest that O2 enrichment may promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, thereby making FDA approval and clinical transformation of these paradigms challenging.In an effort to improve hypoxia photodynamic therapy (hPDT) in the clinic, we have explored \"low to no O2-dependent\" photochemical approaches over the years to combat hypoxia-induced resistance. In this Account, we present our contributions to this theme during the past 5 years, beginning with low O2-dependent approaches (e.g., type I superoxide radical (O2&#8226;-) generator, photodynamic O2-economizer, mitochondrial respiration inhibition, cellular self-protective pathway modulation, etc.) and progressing to O2-independent strategies (e.g., autoadaptive PDT/PTT complementary therapy, O2-independent artificial photoredox catalysis in cells). These studies have attracted tremendous attention. Particularly in the pioneering work of 2018, we presented the first demonstration that the O2&#8226;--mediated partial O2-recyclability mechanism can overcome PDT resistance ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018, 140, 14851-14859). This launched an era of renewed interest in type I PDT, resulting in a plethora of new O2&#8226;- photogenerators developed by many groups around the world. Moreover, with the discovery of O2-independent photoredox reactions in living cells, artificial photoredox catalysis has emerged as a new field connecting photochemistry and biomedicine, stimulating the development of next-generation phototherapeutic tools ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 163-173). Our recent work also disclosed that \"photoredox catalysis in cells\" might be a general mechanism of action of PDT ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2022, 119, e2210504119). These emergent concepts, molecular designs, photochemical mechanisms, and applications in cancer diagnosis and therapeutics, as well as pros and cons, are discussed in depth in this Account. It is expected that our contributions to date will be of general use to researchers and inspire future efforts to identify more promising hPDT approaches that better meet the clinical needs of cancer therapy.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36323621': {'ArticleTitle': 'The association of upward economic mobility with textbook outcomes among patients undergoing general and cardiovascular surgery.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'While disadvantaged neighborhoods may be associated with worse outcomes and earlier death, the relationship between economic opportunity and surgical outcomes remains unexplored.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36323618': {'ArticleTitle': 'Tumor Microenvironment-Activated Hydrogel Platform with Programmed Release Property Evokes a Cascade-Amplified Immune Response against Tumor Growth, Metastasis and Recurrence.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'In situ tumor vaccines (ITV) have been recognized as a promising antitumor strategy since they contain the entire tumor-specific antigens, avoiding tumor cells from evading immune surveillance due to antigen loss. However, the therapeutic benefits of ITV are limited by obstacles such as insufficient antigen loading, inadequate immune system activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME). Herein, a tumor microenvironment-activated hydrogel platform (TED-Gel) with programmed drug release property is constructed for cascaded amplification of the anti-tumor immune response elicited by ITV. Both doxorubicin (Dox) and cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) are released first, in which Dox induces immunogenic tumor cell death causing additional tumor antigen release and leading the dying primary tumor cells into autologous tumor vaccine, and the released CpG promotes antigen presenting cell activation. Subsequently, the decomposed scaffold materials in conjunction with CpG, turn the anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages into the M1 type, reversing the immunosuppressive TME. With decomposition of the TED-Gel, large amounts of macromolecule anti-PD-L1 antibodies are liberated, reinvigorating the exhausted effector T cells. In vivo studies demonstrate that TED-Gel significantly inhibits the primary, distant and rechallenged tumor growth.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the role of associative learning in the persistence of fatigue using a preclinical model of cancer survivorship. For this purpose, we used a murine model of human papilloma virus-related head and neck cancer paired with a curative regimen of cisplatin-based chemoradiation in male C57BL/6J mice. Fatigue-like behavior was assessed by measuring variations in voluntary wheel running using a longitudinal design. Treatment robustly decreased voluntary wheel running, and this effect persisted for more than a month posttreatment. However, when wheels were removed, to minimize treatment-related fatigue, mice showed a more rapid return to baseline running levels. We confirmed that the delayed recovery observed in mice with continual wheel access was not due to increased treatment-related toxicity, in fact running attenuated cisplatin-induced kidney toxicity.

Also, the levels of lipids such as phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were again lower and their relative abundances in the organic phase of GB cancer samples were different from those of other samples. IR spectral features of the aqueous, organic, and amphiphilic aggregate phases were individually characteristic, while not descriptive enough for the thorough identification of GB cancer.

Raman spectroscopy is a rapid, sensitive and nondestructive detection method. In this study, a total of 20,000 Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of melanocytes and melanoma cells were collected using a positively charged gold nanoparticles planar solid SERS substrate, and a classification network system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was constructed to achieve the classification of melanocytes and melanoma cells, wild-type and mutant melanoma cells and their drug resistance. Among them, the classification accuracy of melanocytes and melanoma cells was over 98%. Raman spectral differences between melanocytes and melanoma cells were analyzed and compared, and the response of cells to antitumor drugs were also evaluated.

The independent HCC cohort in The Cancer Gene Atlas (n=360) was utilized to validate our findings. Finally, molecular signatures associated with SOX9-high HCC were determined.

Even TP53 mutations made no exceptions and their dismal effect, including multi-hit allelic status, on survival was almost completely mitigated by the presence of DDX41 mutations.

We implement this method as the excerno R package. We tested excerno by simulating mutations across all 60-baseline mutational signatures from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and combining them with mutations following the FFPE mutational signature. The sensitivity and specificity of excerno are adversely affected by the cosine similarity between the baseline and FFPE signatures (cosFFPE).

An RNA-focused small-molecule fragment collection (n = 2500) was constructed by analyzing features in all publicly reported compounds that bind RNA, the largest collection of RNA-focused fragments to date. The RNA-binding landscape for each fragment was studied by using a library-versus-library selection with an RNA library displaying a discrete structural element, probing over 12.8 million interactions, the greatest number of interactions between fragments and biomolecules probed experimentally. Mining of this dataset across the human transcriptome defined a drug-like fragment that potently and specifically targeted the microRNA-372 hairpin precursor, inhibiting its processing into the mature, functional microRNA and alleviating invasive and proliferative oncogenic phenotypes in gastric cancer cells.

Here we demonstrate that IGF2BP2 binds to the 3' untranslated region of the transcript encoding ATP6V1A, a catalytic subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), and serves as a substrate for the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which regulates how IGF2BP2 affects the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript. When sufficient levels of SIRT1 are expressed, it catalyzes the deacetylation of IGF2BP2, which can bind to the ATP6V1A transcript but does not mediate its degradation. However, when SIRT1 expression is low, the acetylated form of IGF2BP2 accumulates, and upon binding to the ATP6V1A transcript recruits the XRN2 nuclease, which catalyzes transcript degradation. Thus, the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript is significantly compromised in breast cancer cells when SIRT1 expression is low or knocked-down. This leads to a reduction in the expression of functional v-ATPase complexes in cancer cells and to an impairment in their lysosomal activity, resulting in the production of a cellular secretome consisting of increased numbers of exosomes enriched in ubiquitinated protein cargo and soluble hydrolases, including cathepsins, that together combine to promote tumor cell survival and invasiveness.

Mechanistically, myocardial tissue from ICI-treated mice, the genetic mouse model, and human heart tissue from affected patients with ICI myocarditis all exhibited down-regulation of MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) and HSPA5 (heat shock 70-kDa protein 5) in the heart; this down-regulation was particularly notable in female mice. ICI myocarditis was amplified by heart-specific genetic deletion of mouse Manf and was attenuated by administration of recombinant MANF protein, suggesting a causal role. Ironically, both MANF and HSPA5 were transcriptionally induced by liganded estrogen receptor &#946; and inhibited by androgen receptor. However, ICI treatment reduced serum estradiol concentration to a greater extent in female compared to male mice. Treatment with an estrogen receptor &#946;-specific agonist and androgen depletion therapy attenuated ICI-associated cardiac effects. Together, our data suggest that ICI treatment inhibits estradiol-dependent expression of MANF/HSPA5 in the heart, curtailing the cardiomyocyte response to immune injury. This endocrine-cardiac-immune pathway offers new insights into the mechanisms of sex differences in cardiac disease and may offer treatment strategies for ICI myocarditis.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36322626': {'ArticleTitle': 'TRIM35-mediated degradation of nuclear PKM2 destabilizes GATA4/6 and induces P53 in cardiomyocytes to promote heart failure.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a glycolytic enzyme that translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription factors in different tissues or pathologic states. Although studied extensively in cancer, its biological role in the heart remains unresolved. PKM1 is more abundant than the PKM2 isoform in cardiomyocytes, and thus, we speculated that PKM2 is not genetically redundant to PKM1 and may be critical in regulating cardiomyocyte-specific transcription factors important for cardiac survival. Here, we showed that nuclear PKM2 (S37P-PKM2) in cardiomyocytes interacts with prosurvival and proapoptotic transcription factors, including GATA4, GATA6, and P53. Cardiomyocyte-specific PKM2-deficient mice (Pkm2 Mut Cre+) developed age-dependent dilated cardiac dysfunction and had decreased amounts of GATA4 and GATA6 (GATA4/6) but increased amounts of P53 compared to Control Cre+&#160;hearts. Nuclear PKM2 prevented caspase-1-dependent cleavage and degradation of GATA4/6 while also providing a molecular platform for MDM2-mediated reduction of P53. In a preclinical heart failure mouse model, nuclear PKM2 and GATA4/6 were decreased, whereas P53 was increased in cardiomyocytes. Loss of nuclear PKM2 was ubiquitination dependent and associated with the induction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM35. In mice, cardiomyocyte-specific TRIM35 overexpression resulted in decreased S37P-PKM2 and GATA4/6 along with increased P53 in cardiomyocytes compared to littermate controls and similar cardiac dysfunction to Pkm2 Mut Cre+&#160;mice. In patients with dilated left ventricles, increase in TRIM35 was associated with decreased S37P-PKM2 and GATA4/6 and increased P53.

The medical data classification faces the imbalanced count of data samples, here at least one class forms only a very small minority of the data, but it is a drawback of most of the machine learning algorithms. The medical datasets are mostly imbalanced in its class labels. When the dataset is imbalanced, the existing classification algorithms typically perform badly on minority class cases. To deal the class imbalance issue, an enhanced generative adversarial network (E-GAN) is proposed in this article. The proposed approach is the consolidation of deep convolutional generative adversarial network and modified convolutional neural network (DCG-MCNN). Initially, the imbalanced data is converted into balanced data in pre-processing process. Data preprocessing comprise of data cleaning, data normalization, data transformation and data reduction using Radius Synthetic minority oversampling technique (RSMOTE) method.

A 54-year-old man presented with progressive cervical radiculopathy that had persisted for 3 months. The underlying disease was HCC. Radiographic examination revealed evidence of metastatic spinal cord compression with an epidural mass at the C4-C5 levels, which compressed the C4-C5 spinal cord without bony destruction. The modified Tomita score was 6 to 8 points based on palliative surgery. A posterior full-endoscopic approach to remove the tumor from the metastasis of HCC in the cervical spine was done.

This can result in hemodynamic instability in the presence of other bleeding sources. It is oftentimes difficult to diagnose due to its limitations to visual inspection of the oropharyngeal structures. It is commonly mistaken for hemoptysis or hematemesis upon initial evaluation. Trauma, infection, pulmonary pathologies (ie, lung cancer or tuberculosis), gastrointestinal pathologies (ie, esophageal/gastric varices, Mallory-Weiss tears, esophagitis), coagulopathies, medications, and prolonged intubation have been shown to increase the risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with a medical history of alcohol use disorder, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and gastric varices presented with altered mental status. He was subsequently intubated for airway protection. Bleeding from the oropharynx was later found. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and bronchoscopy were unrevealing. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck revealed active bleeding of the right posterior pharyngeal artery, which was emergently embolized. Over the next few days, he continued to bleed from the oropharynx and became hemodynamically unstable. CTA abdomen showed bleeding from gastric varices and large-volume hemoperitoneum with multiple sources of active bleeding from the liver, duodenum, and jejunum. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage and gastric variceal bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic shock in a cirrhotic patient with multiple predisposing factors. If a patient presents with spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage, clinicians should consider bleeding from the oropharynx if EGD and bronchoscopy are unrevealing. Thus, an emergent CTA of the head and neck should be strongly considered to further evaluate a potential source of active bleeding, as delayed diagnosis can be life-threatening.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36322480': {'ArticleTitle': 'Ultrasound-Mediated Antitumor Therapy via Targeted Acoustic Release Carrier of Carbon Monoxide (TARC-CO).', 'ArticleAbstract': 'As one of the most valuable endogenous gas signaling molecules, carbon monoxide (CO) has been demonstrated in numerous studies to show excellent promise in the treatment of diseases, such as cancer. However, for many years, the inherent high affinity of CO for hemoglobin severely impeded the clinical transformation of CO-based treatments. Therefore, the controlled delivery of CO to target tissues has become a common challenge. Herein, an efficient ultrasonic-triggered and targeted CO release strategy was constructed based on a novel targeted acoustic release carrier of carbon monoxide (TARC-CO) that we synthesized in this study. The designed TARC-COs could afford a safe, stable, and ultrasound-guided delivery of CO in vivo by loading a specified dose of CO inside microbubbles, resulting in breast tumor suppression. Taking advantage of the high loading capacity of microbubbles, the unit volume of TARC-CO suspension could encapsulate up to 337.1 &#177; 8.0 (&#215;103 ppm) of CO. In addition, the satisfactory ultrasound contrast-enhanced ability of TARC-COs achieved real-time interactive guidance and visual policing of CO delivery. For the in vitro antitumor study, TARC-COs with ultrasonic irradiation were demonstrated to effectively induce mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the apoptosis of 4T1 cells. In addition, we realized that TARC-CO-based treatment could significantly slow the growth rate of tumors by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, and limiting tumor angiogenesis. In summary, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility and tremendous potential of TARC-COs for controlled release of CO, which can be expected to provide new inspirations and a promising perspective for therapy based on active gases.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36322473': {'ArticleTitle': 'A cytotoxic survey on 2-amino-1H-imidazol based synthetic marine sponge alkaloid analogues.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Here, we describe the synthesis and biologic activity evaluation of 20 novel synthetic marine sponge alkaloid analogues with 2-amino-1H-imidazol (2-AI) core.

In 1981, Best and Hoekstra reported four patients with BWSp in a single family which suggested autosomal dominant inheritance, but standard clinical testing for BWSp was not available during this time. Meticulous phenotyping of this family has occurred over the past 40&#8201;years of follow-up with additional family members being identified and samples collected for genetic testing. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in CDKN1C, consistent with the most common cause of familial BWSp. CDKN1C mutations account for just 5% of sporadic cases of BWSp. Here, we report the variable presentation of BWSp across the individuals affected by the CDKN1C mutation and other extended family members spanning multiple generations, all examined by the same physician. Additional phenotypes thought to be atypical in patients with BWSp were reported which included cardiac abnormalities. The incidence of tumors was documented in extended family members and included rhabdomyosarcoma, astrocytoma, and thyroid carcinoma, which have previously been reported in patients with BWSp. These observations suggest that in addition to the inheritance of the CDKN1C variant, there are modifying factors in this family driving the phenotypic spectrum observed. Alternative theories are suggested to explain the etiology of clinical variability including diffused mosaicism, anticipation, and the presence of additional variants tracking in the family.

However, this simple division of labor model struggles to explain why TFs with identical DNA binding sequence specificity determined in vitro exhibit distinct binding profiles in vivo. The family of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) offer a stark example: aberrantly expressed in several cancer types, HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; subunit isoforms recognize the same DNA motif in vitro - the hypoxia response element (HRE) - but only share a subset of their target genes in vivo, while eliciting contrasting effects on cancer development and progression under certain circumstances. To probe the mechanisms mediating isoform-specific gene regulation, we used live cell single particle tracking (SPT) to investigate HIF nuclear dynamics and how they change upon genetic perturbation or drug treatment. We found that HIF-&#945; subunits and their dimerization partner HIF-1&#946; exhibit distinct diffusion and binding characteristics that are exquisitely sensitive to concentration and subunit stoichiometry. Using domain-swap variants, mutations, and a HIF-2&#945; specific inhibitor, we found that although the DBD and dimerization domains are important, another main determinant of chromatin binding and diffusion behavior is the AD-containing intrinsically disordered region (IDR).

An initial response to an epithelial wound is an increase in cytosolic calcium followed by complex calcium signaling events. While these calcium signals are driven by both physical and chemical wound responses, cells around the wound will all be equipped with the same cellular components to produce and interact with the calcium signals. Here, we have developed a mathematical model in the context of laser-ablation of the Drosophila pupal notum that integrates tissue-level damage models with a cellular calcium signaling toolkit. The model replicates experiments in the contexts of control wounds as well as knockdowns of specific cellular components, but it also provides new insights that are not easily accessible experimentally. The model suggests that cell-cell variability is necessary to produce calcium signaling events observed in experiments, it quantifies calcium concentrations during wound-induced signaling events, and it shows that intercellular transfer of the molecule IP3 is required to coordinate calcium signals across distal cells around the wound. The mathematical model developed here serves as a framework for quantitative studies in both wound signaling and calcium signaling in the Drosophila system.

Axoneme destabilization involves an increased frequency of cilia breaks and a reduction in axonemal microtubule modifications.

Recently, it has been shown that the reduced size of NBs (<1 &#956;m) promotes increased uptake and accumulation in tumor interstitial space, which can enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic performance. However, accurate characterization of NB size and concentration is challenging and may limit their translation into clinical use. Their submicron nature limits accuracy of conventional microscopy techniques, while common light scattering techniques fail to distinguish between subpopulations present in NB samples (i.e., bubbles and liposomes). Due to the difficulty in the characterization of NBs, relatively little is known about the influence of size on their therapeutic performance. In this study, we describe a novel method of using a commercially available nanoparticle tracking analysis system, to distinguish between NBs and liposomes based on their differing optical properties. We used this technique to characterize three NB populations of varying size, isolated via centrifugation, and subsequently used this to assess their potential for enhancing localized delivery. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were used to quantify the ultrasound enhanced uptake of fluorescent dextran into live colorectal cancer cells. Our results showed that the amount of localized uptake did not follow the expected trends, in which larger NB populations out-perform smaller NBs, at matched concentration. To understand this observed behavior, the stability of each NB population was assessed. It was found that dilution of the NB samples from their stock concentration influences their stability, and it is hypothesized that both the total free lipid and interbubble distance play a role in NB lifetime, in agreement with previously proposed theories and models.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36322168': {'ArticleTitle': 'Rare Association Between Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Chondrosarcoma: Could a Pathogenic Variant in the Gene SERPINF1 Explain It?', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VI is a rare inherited disorder of the connective tissue caused by pathogenic variants in&#160;SERPINF1 gene, which encodes the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).

The severity and mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies is clearly higher than the general population. Since the immune response to vaccination in hematologic patients is generally worse than in comparable populations, alternative methods of prevention must be established in these patients, as well as actions for earlier diagnosis and treatment.

Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT in detecting PM based on studies providing head-to-head comparisons between the two tests. Evidence Acquisition: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched through July 2022 to identify studies reporting head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT for detection of PM. Reference standard was classified as histopathology in all patients, or as combination of histopathology, clinical, imaging, laboratory, and follow-up information (i.e., multidisciplinary reference standard). Random-effects statistical model was applied to conduct a meta-analysis of tests' diagnostic performances in patient-based and lesion-based analyses. QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C tools were used to assess study quality. Evidence Synthesis: Eleven studies were included; patient-based analysis comprised nine studies with 340 patients, and lesion-based analysis comprised four studies with 222 lesions. Pooled sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT was significantly higher than that of FDG PET/CT in patient-based analysis [98.2% (95% CI: 96.1-100.0%) vs 55.9% (95% CI: 33.9-77.9%)] and lesion-based analysis [99.9% (95% CI: 99.5-100.0%) vs 27.3% (95% CI: 11.2-43.4%)]. Eight studies were rated as high risk of bias in the reference standard domain because the multidisciplinary reference standard was not sufficiently explained and may have included one of the two index tests, which would have artificially increased sensitivity. Specificity was reported in three studies as 100.0% for both tests; these studies were considered at uncertain risk of bias in the patient selection domain because patients with benign peritoneal conditions may have been excluded, resulting in underestimation of potential false-positive results. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests excellent sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for the detection of PM, in comparison to poorer sensitivity of FDG PET/CT. However, most included studies had high risk of bias, with need for further studies that could more convincingly characterize true- and false-positive results.

Patients completed 6-month postoperative quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires. Results: Patients undergoing lobectomy, versus limited resection, exhibited greater increases in lung volume ratio of ipsilateral nonresected lobe(s) (42.3&#177;24.2% vs 22.9&#177;13.2%, p<.001) and of contralateral lung (14.6&#177;14.0% vs 6.4&#177;6.9%, p=.002), and greater increases in lung perfusion ratio of ipsilateral nonresected lobe(s) (39.9&#177;20.7% vs 22.8&#177;17.8%, p<.001) and of contralateral lung (20.9&#177;9.4% vs 4.3&#177;5.6%, p<.001). In patients with right lower lobe tumors, largest postoperative increases in lung volume ratio were in right middle lobe in those undergoing lobectomy (44.1&#177;21.0%) and limited resection (24.6&#177;14.5%), whereas largest postoperative increase in lung perfusion ratio was in left lower lobe in those undergoing lobectomy (53.9&#177;8.6%) and in right middle lobe in those undergoing limited resection (32.5&#177;24.1%). Otherwise, largest volume and perfusion ratio increases occurred in ipsilateral nonresected lobes (vs contralateral lobes) regardless of operative approach and lobar location.

MicroRNAs (miRs) have been extensively studied as biomarkers in cancer and haematological disorders, and their expression has been correlated to the presence of recurrent molecular abnormalities, expression of oncogenes, as well as to prognosis/clinical outcome. In the present study, expression signatures of different miRs related both to presence of myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukaemia 1 and Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications rearrangements and to the clinical outcome of paediatric patients with AML were identified. Notably, miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p resulted as a possible relapse-risk related miR.

Realgar is an impelling anticancer drug, however its significance in KRAS mutant lung cancer is uncertain. According to our findings, the IC50 of H23 (KRAS mutant) cells is 2.99&#160;times lower than that of H1650 (non&#8209;KRAS mutant) cells. Flow cytometry and the Hoechst 33258 staining assay revealed that H1650 cells treated with 4&#160;&#181;g/ml realgar had an apoptotic rate of 8.2%, while H23 cells had a rate of 21.46%. Accordingly, realgar was more sensitive to KRAS mutant cells. Transcriptome sequencing test indicated that there were 481 different expression genes in H23 cells treated with realgar. In H23 cells treated with realgar, mitochondria shrank, inner membrane folding was disturbed, and mitochondrial membrane potential crushed. Realgar boosted intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and glutathione levels, which were all reversed by ferroptosis inhibitor Fer&#8209;1.

Its target antigen was identified as the bromodomain&#8209;containing protein 2 (BRD2), a transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional control of diverse genes. BRD2 was upregulated in HCC tissues of the H&#8209;ras12V&#8209;tg mouse and human subjects, as demonstrated using western blotting or immunohistochemical analysis, with the BRD2 autoantibody. In addition, the truncated BRD2 reactive to the BRD2 autoantibody was detected in tumor cell&#8209;derived exosomes, which possibly activated TA immune responses and the generation of autoantibodies. For the detection of the serum BRD2 autoantibody, epitope mimicries of autoantigenic BRD2 were screened from a random cyclic peptide CX7C library with the BRD2 autoantibody. A mimotope with the sequence of CTSVFLPHC, which was cyclized by one pair of cysteine residues, exhibited high affinity to the BRD2 autoantibody and competitively inhibited the binding of the autoantibody to the cellular BRD2 antigen. The use of this cyclic peptide as a capture antigen in human serum enzyme&#8209;linked immunosorbent assay allowed the distinction of patients with HCC from healthy subjects with 64.41% sensitivity and 82.42% specificity (area under the ROC curve, 0.7761), which is superior to serum alpha&#8209;fetoprotein (AFP; 35.83% sensitivity; 100% specificity; area under the ROC curve, 0.5337) for the diagnosis of HCC.

The combination of photothermal and immunotherapy has proven to be a promising method to conquer technical challenges. Inhibiting the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immune pathway represents one of the most successful immunotherapy strategies. Whereas, the PD-L1 expression level significantly differs, leading to a relatively low response rate to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) approaches. Therefore, improving the expression level of PD-L1 becomes one potential method to enhance the response rate. Herein, NIH 3T3 cells were educated to steadily express PD-1 protein. Furthermore, the synthesized molybdenum nitride was then coated with PD-1 protein-modified cytomembrane, which endows it with immune checkpoint blocking capability. Moreover, under the irradiation of near-infrared light, the local mild heat released from the molybdenum nitride causes the apoptosis of tumor cells. More importantly, the elevated temperature simultaneously helps elevate the expression level of PD-L1, further enhancing the response rate of ICB. Finally, the PD-1 cytomembrane coatings interact with the upregulated PD-L1, leading to the activation of the immune system. In summary, we confirmed that the PD-1 protein-coated molybdenum nitride could synergistically ablate tumors and avoid metastasis.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36321627': {'ArticleTitle': 'Metal complexes of a pro-vitamin K3 analog phthiocol (2-hydroxy-3-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione): synthesis, characterization, and anticancer activity.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'The hydroxy analog of vitamin K3 (2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione) is known as phthiocol (2-hydroxy-3-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione; pht). Both vitamin K3 and phthiocol possess anticancer and antihemorrhagic properties. Phthiocol is a noninnocent ligand and provides monodentate, bidentate, or tridentate coordination sites to metal ions. A series of transition metal complexes (Mn(II); 1 and 1A, Co(II); 2 and 2A, Ni(II); 3 and 3A, Cu(II); 4 and 4A, and Zn(II); 5 and 5A) are synthesized at 0 &#176;C using sodium metal (1 to 5) and at 26 &#176;C (1A to 5A). The chemical composition of the complexes obtained is of the type [M(phthiocolate)2(H2O)2]. At room temperature (26 &#176;C), trans coordination of the phthiocolate ligand is achieved (1A through 5A), whereas at 0 &#176;C and using sodium metal as a reductant, cis coordination is observed in Mn(II) complexes (1 and its methanol adduct 1B). A Na(I) complex of phthiocol, Na(pht), is isolated as a polymer. The ligand phthiocol and the complexes Na(pht), 1, 1A, and 3 crystallize in a monoclinic crystal system. X-ray structures reveal that the bond distances of coordinated phthiocol ligands are in the reduced naphthosemiquinone form in the complexes synthesized at 0 &#176;C. The metal complexes of phthiocol (pht) were evaluated for their anticancer activity against MCF-7 (breast) and A549 (lung) cancer cell lines. Experiments like apoptosis, mitochondrial potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, effect on the cell cycle, and cell proliferation were performed to compare selected complexes against both cell lines. The metal complexes of phthiocol synthesized at 0 &#176;C showed substantial cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and A549 cell lines.

A 34-year-old man presented to our department with a complaint of soft pain in the vestibular aspect of left mandibular second premolar and left mandibular first molar. Vital teeth in the left mandible, no mucosal swelling, and no drainage were observed. The CBCT showed a well circumscribed hypodensity area, extending between 3.5 and the apex of mesial root of 3.6. No displacement and no resorption of the roots were notified. Upon clinical and radiographical examination, a provisional diagnosis of LPC was made and enucleation of the lesion and histological examination were planned. Histologically, a cystic wall partially lined by a keratinizing squamous epithelium was observed. Surrounding and within the lesion, there was a chronic inflammatory infiltrate also of granulomatous type and with cholesterol clefts. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of odontogenic keratocystic was done. Radiolucent lesions in the premolar and canine region are frequently clinically and radiographically misdiagnosed.

Runt-related transcription factors (RUNXs), RUNX1-3, are the master regulators of development and differentiation and are all important to the development of immune cells. However, the role of RUNXs in the immune cells of TME remains unclear. In this study, we first used online related databases and related LGG data from TCGA and CGGA to conduct bioinformatics analysis, which confirmed that RUNXs were significantly and positively correlated with immune infiltration in multiple tumors, especially in low-grade glioma (LGG) and there was the highest correlation between RUNXs and the progress and prognosis of LGG. Furthermore, the functional enrichment analysis revealed that RUNXs might be involved in the inflammatory and immune responses of the biological processes, and RUNXs were tightly associated with the multiple immune checkpoint molecules. Subsequent results confirmed that RUNX1, as an independent prognostic factor for LGG, may target interferon-gamma receptor 2 (IFNGR2) to regulate glioma cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Besides, we also found that the expression levels of RUNX1 and IFNGR2 were significantly reduced, and their correlation was enhanced in the IDH-mutant subtype. Patients with a high expression of RUNX1 and/or IFNGR2 (HH/H) in the IDH-mutant subtype showed poorer prognosis and significantly increased infiltration of M2 macrophages.

In order to investigate the role of molecular chaperones in driving CRC initiation, we captured the transcriptomic profiles of murine wild type and Apc-mutant organoids during active transformation.

Here, we found that long-term metformin exposure led to metabolic adaptation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was characterized by an obvious epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and compensatory elevation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). TOMM34, a translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, was upregulated to promote tumor metastasis in response to metformin-induced metabolic stress. Mechanistically, TOMM34 interacted with ATP5B to preserve F1 FO -ATPase activity, which conferred mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP production. This metabolic preference for OXPHOS suggested a large requirement of energy supply by cancer cells to survive and spread in response to therapeutic stress. Notably, disturbing the interaction between TOMM34 and ATP5B using Gboxin, a specific OXPHOS inhibitor, increased sensitivity to metformin and suppressed tumor progression both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo.

The kinase Kin4, one of the most downstream SPOC components, is essential to stop the mitotic exit network (MEN), a signalling pathway that promotes the exit from mitosis and cell division. Previous work, however, suggested that a Kin4-independent pathway contributes to SPOC, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we established the glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 (GSK-3) homologue Mck1, as a novel component that works independently of Kin4 to engage SPOC. Our data indicate that both Kin4 and Mck1 work in parallel to counteract MEN activation by the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) network. We show that Mck1's function in SPOC is mediated by the pre-replication complex protein and mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (M-Cdk) inhibitor, Cdc6, which is degraded in a Mck1-dependent manner prior to mitosis. Moderate overproduction of Cdc6 phenocopies MCK1 deletion and causes SPOC deficiency via its N-terminal, M-Cdk inhibitory domain.

Although&#160;tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, is widely used to treat ER-positive breast cancers, resistance to TAM remains a major clinical problem. NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is known to participate in drug metabolism and steroid metabolism. Recent studies showed that high POR expression was correlated with poor outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and POR might be a prognostic biomarker in TNBC. However, the role of POR in TAM resistance is still elusive. In this study, we found that high POR expression was associated with poor prognosis of ER-positive and TAM-treated breast cancer patients. In addition, COX analysis showed that POR expression was an independent prognostic biomarker for ER-positive as well as TAM-treated breast cancer patients. Furthermore, our results suggested that POR overexpression promoted TAM resistance by activating the STAT1/c-Myc pathway in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that high POR/STAT1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in TAM-treated breast cancer patients. Notably, combined treatment with TAM and a specific STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine was more effective for inhibiting TAM-resistant breast cancer cells. Altogether, our findings suggested that POR overexpression induced TAM resistance through STAT1/c-Myc pathway and might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker in TAM-treated breast cancer patients.

Saponins from Platycodi radix (SPR) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate CRC cell progression. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detected miR-181c-5p, miR-181d-5p, and RBM47 expression level. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays validated that miR-181c-5p and miR-181d-5p promote CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and SPR exerts opposite effects. Cignal Finder Reporter Array and western blot proved that the activity of PI3K/AKT pathway was decreased by RBM47 overexpression. RNA pulldown, luciferase reporter, and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays proved the interaction between miR-181c/d-5p and RBM47, and RBM47 and PTEN. Rescue experiments were carried out to validate that RBM47 reverses the influence of miR-181c/d-5p on the progression of CRC cells. The stability of PTEN was probed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in CRC cells treated with Actinomycin D (Act D).

Recently, GATOR1 (Gap Activity TOward Rags 1) complexes have been shown to play an important role in regulating tumor growth. NPRL2 is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex. Therefore, this study used NPRL2 knockdown to investigate how GATORC1 regulates the prognosis and development of HCC via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and autophagy signaling pathways. We established HepG2 cells with NPRL2 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) systems. The siRNA-mediated and shRNA-mediated NPRL2 down-regulation significantly reduced the expression of NPRL2 and two other GATPOR1 complex components, NPRL3 and DEPDC5, in HepG2 cells; furthermore, the efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 protein expression by both the shRNA and siRNA systems enhanced the proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro. Additionally, the NPRL2 down-regulation significantly increased HCC growth in the subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. The NPRL2 down-regulation increased the Rag GTPases and mTOR activation and inhibited autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the NPRL2 level in the tumors was significantly associated with mortality, recurrence, the serum alpha fetoprotein level, the tumor size, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. Low NPRL2, NPRL3, DEPDC5, and LC3, and high p62 and mTOR protein expression in the tumors was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in 300 patients with HCC after surgical resection. Conclusion: The efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 significantly increased HCC proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro, and increased HCC growth in vivo. Low NPRL2 protein expression in the tumors was closely correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with HCC.

Here, we focus on recent advances in cardiovascular risk assessment and management and their implications for pediatric practice. First, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are highly prevalent in the young, with hyperlipidemia occurring in 14.6% and hyperglycemia in 16.4% of children and adolescents with a normal weight.

By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively-triggerable metals, we leveraged a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, we demonstrate that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically-relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure.

To date, no efficient treatment is available for GBC patients. Based on the data from cBioPortal, TIMER, and GDSC, we performed an unbiased screening with 25 candidate compounds that predominantly target ErbB family and identified HKI-272, a highly selective EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor, displayed decreased IC50 values in three GBC cell lines. HKI-272 not only promoted gemcitabine-mediated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and induced cell cycle arrest in GBC, but also enhanced gemcitabine-induced suppressive effects of GBC cell migration and invasion by inhibiting pathways downstream of EGFR. Furthermore, HKI-272, together with gemcitabine, effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastases in mouse models. Immunostaining and HE staining data from both primary tumor and lung metastasis indicated that the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects were mediated through EGFR suppression. Moreover, the expression of EGFR, measured by both immunostaining and HE staining, was correlated with a poor prognosis in GBC.

Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), fatty liver, hepatocyte injury, unbalanced proinflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, liver inflammation, and fibrosis are the main pathogenesis in NAFLD. Recent studies suggest that the action of intestinal microbiota through chronic inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and energy uptake plays a vital role in NAFLD.

Most studies focused on the gas and liquid phase of diluted solutions of pyruvic acid to understand the impact of sun light on the degradation of this molecule in the atmosphere. By analyzing concentrated supercooled solutions at 77 K, we demonstrate that instead of decarboxylating, the pyruvic acid molecule plays the role of electron donor and transfers an electron to an acceptor molecule that subsequently degrades to form CO2. We show that this electron transfer occurs via hydrogen bonding and that in aqueous solutions of pyruvic acid, the hydrated form is the electron acceptor. These findings demonstrate that photo-induced electron transfer via hydrogen bonding can occur between two simple carboxylic acids and that this mechanism governs the photochemistry of pyruvic acid, providing unexplored alternative pathways for the decarboxylation of photo-inactive molecules.', 'query': 'Cancer'}, '36320893': {'ArticleTitle': 'QSAR models reveal new EPAC-selective allosteric modulators.', 'ArticleAbstract': 'Exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPases, Rap1 and Rap2.
